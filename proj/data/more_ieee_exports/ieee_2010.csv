"A Survey on Transfer Learning","S. J. Pan; Q.

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5288526","Transfer learning;survey;machine learning;data mining.","Machine learning;Training data;Data mining;Knowledge transfer;Space technology;Knowledge engineering;Machine learning algorithms;Labeling;Learning systems;Testing","","14979","55","88","IEEE","16 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5255236","Object recognition;deformable models;pictorial structures;discriminative training;latent SVM.","Object detection;Deformable models;Support vector machines;Bicycles;Computer vision;Shape;Speech recognition;Computer Society;Iterative algorithms;Lighting","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Discriminant Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","7479","139","45","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Until recently the ability to infer evolutionary relationships was limited by the amount of DNA sequence data available, but new DNA sequencing technologies have largely removed this limitation. As a result, DNA sequence data are readily available or obtainable for a wide spectrum of organisms, thus creating an unprecedented opportunity to explore evolutionary relationships broadly and deeply across the Tree of Life. Unfortunately, the algorithms used to infer evolutionary relationships are NP-hard, so the dramatic increase in available DNA sequence data has created a commensurate increase in the need for access to powerful computational resources. Local laptop or desktop machines are no longer viable for analysis of the larger data sets available today, and progress in the field relies upon access to large, scalable high-performance computing resources. This paper describes development of the CIPRES Science Gateway, a web portal designed to provide researchers with transparent access to the fastest available community codes for inference of phylogenetic relationships, and implementation of these codes on scalable computational resources. Meeting the needs of the community has included developing infrastructure to provide access, working with the community to improve existing community codes, developing infrastructure to insure the portal is scalable to the entire systematics community, and adopting strategies that make the project sustainable by the community. The CIPRES Science Gateway has allowed more than 1800 unique users to run jobs that required 2.5 million Service Units since its release in December 2009. (A Service Unit is a CPU-hour at unit priority).","2152-1093","978-1-4244-9752-2","10.1109/GCE.2010.5676129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676129","Science Gateway;TeraGrid;Cyberinfrastructure;Systematics;Phylogenetics;CIPRES","Portals;Logic gates;Communities;Phylogeny;Computer architecture;DNA;XML","","6893","2","24","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Time-division duplex operation combined with reverse-link pilots enables the base station to estimate the reciprocal forward- and reverse-link channels. The conjugate-transpose of the channel estimates are used as a linear precoder and combiner respectively on the forward and reverse links. Propagation, unknown to both terminals and base station, comprises fast fading, log-normal shadow fading, and geometric attenuation. In the limit of an infinite number of antennas a complete multi-cellular analysis, which accounts for inter-cellular interference and the overhead and errors associated with channel-state information, yields a number of mathematically exact conclusions and points to a desirable direction towards which cellular wireless could evolve. In particular the effects of uncorrelated noise and fast fading vanish, throughput and the number of terminals are independent of the size of the cells, spectral efficiency is independent of bandwidth, and the required transmitted energy per bit vanishes. The only remaining impairment is inter-cellular interference caused by re-use of the pilot sequences in other cells (pilot contamination) which does not vanish with unlimited number of antennas.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2010.092810.091092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5595728","Multiuser MIMO;pilot contamination;noncooperative cellular wireless;active antenna arrays","Base stations;Antennas;OFDM;Fading;MIMO;Arrays","","5016","229","22","IEEE","7 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low-resolution and high-resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low-resolution image patch can be applied with the high-resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high-resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs , reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution (SR) and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle SR with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2050625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466111","Face hallucination;image super-resolution (SR);nonnegative matrix factorization;sparse coding;sparse representation","Image resolution;Signal resolution;Dictionaries;Signal representations;Statistics;Compressed sensing;Computational efficiency;Image generation;Strontium;Noise robustness","","3980","54","34","IEEE","18 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting.

As a consequence, the CK database has been used for both AU and emotion detection (even though labels for the latter have not been validated), comparison with benchmark algorithms is missing, and use of random subsets of the original database makes meta-analyses difficult.

Direct observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space will allow significantly improved estimates of water, energy, and carbon transfers between the land and the atmosphere. The accuracy of numerical models of the atmosphere used in weather prediction and climate projections are critically dependent on the correct characterization of these transfers. Soil moisture measurements are also directly applicable to flood assessment and drought monitoring. SMAP observations can help monitor these natural hazards, resulting in potentially great economic and social benefits. SMAP observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw timing will also reduce a major uncertainty in quantifying the global carbon balance by helping to resolve an apparent missing carbon sink on land over the boreal latitudes. The SMAP mission concept will utilize L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna to provide high-resolution and high-accuracy global maps of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state every two to three days. In addition, the SMAP project will use these observations with advanced modeling and data assimilation to provide deeper root-zone soil moisture and net ecosystem exchange of carbon.

Visual tracking requires robust filters to be trained from a single frame and dynamically adapted as the appearance of the target object changes. This paper presents a new type of correlation filter, a Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) filter, which produces stable correlation filters when initialized using a single frame. A tracker based upon MOSSE filters is robust to variations in lighting, scale, pose, and nonrigid deformations while operating at 669 frames per second.

LLC utilizes the locality constraints to project each descriptor into its local-coordinate system, and the projected coordinates are integrated by max pooling to generate the final representation. With linear classifier, the proposed approach performs remarkably better than the traditional nonlinear SPM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Compared with the sparse coding strategy [22], the objective function used by LLC has an analytical solution. In addition, the paper proposes a fast approximated LLC method by first performing a K-nearest-neighbor search and then solving a constrained least square fitting problem, bearing computational complexity of O(M + K2). Hence even with very large codebooks, our system can still process multiple frames per second. This efficiency significantly adds to the practical values of LLC for real applications.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540018","","Image coding;Image classification","","2263","23","26","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services.

Without coordination of the charging, the vehicles are charged instantaneously when they are plugged in or after a fixed start delay. This uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore, coordinated charging is proposed to minimize the power losses and to maximize the main grid load factor.

The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2010.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432191","Registration;correspondence;matching;alignment;rigid;nonrigid;point sets;Coherent Point Drift (CPD);Gaussian mixture model (GMM);coherence;regularization;EM algorithm.","Stereo vision;Computational complexity;Computer vision;Coherence;Image registration;Shape;Image recognition;Feature extraction;Degradation;Biomedical imaging","","2073","24","49","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The keys to the performance of the proposed algorithm are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Simple but effective methods are also proposed to turn the resulting patch model into a mesh which can be further refined by an algorithm that enforces both photometric consistency and regularization constraints. The proposed approach automatically detects and discards outliers and obstacles and does not require any initialization in the form of a visual hull, a bounding box, or valid depth ranges. We have tested our algorithm on various data sets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and ""crowded"" scenes where moving obstacles appear in front of a static structure of interest.

Under this framework, the consensus of multiagent systems with a communication topology having a spanning tree can be cast into the stability of a set of matrices of the same low dimension. The notion of consensus region is then introduced and analyzed. It is shown that there exists an observer-type protocol solving the consensus problem and meanwhile yielding an unbounded consensus region if and only if each agent is both stabilizable and detectable. A multistep consensus protocol design procedure is further presented. The consensus with respect to a time-varying state and the robustness of the consensus protocol to external disturbances are finally discussed.

Like SVMs, FMs are a general predictor working with any real valued feature vector. In contrast to SVMs, FMs model all interactions between variables using factorized parameters. Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. We show that FMs can mimic these models just by specifying the input data (i.e. the feature vectors). This makes FMs easily applicable even for users without expert knowledge in factorization models.","2374-8486","978-1-4244-9131-5","10.1109/ICDM.2010.127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694074","factorization machine;sparse data;tensor factorization;support vector machine","Mathematical model;Support vector machines;Frequency modulation;Predictive models;Data models;Equations;Computational modeling","","1805","6","8","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We tackle this by combining the strengths of robust illumination normalization, local texture-based face representations, distance transform based matching, kernel-based feature extraction and multiple feature fusion. Specifically, we make three main contributions: 1) we present a simple and efficient preprocessing chain that eliminates most of the effects of changing illumination while still preserving the essential appearance details that are needed for recognition; 2) we introduce local ternary patterns (LTP), a generalization of the local binary pattern (LBP) local texture descriptor that is more discriminant and less sensitive to noise in uniform regions, and we show that replacing comparisons based on local spatial histograms with a distance transform based similarity metric further improves the performance of LBP/LTP based face recognition; and 3) we further improve robustness by adding Kernel principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction and incorporating rich local appearance cues from two complementary sources-Gabor wavelets and LBP-showing that the combination is considerably more accurate than either feature set alone. The resulting method provides state-of-the-art performance on three data sets that are widely used for testing recognition under difficult illumination conditions: Extended Yale-B, CAS-PEAL-R1, and Face Recognition Grand Challenge version 2 experiment 4 (FRGC-204). For example, on the challenging FRGC-204 data set it halves the error rate relative to previously published methods, achieving a face verification rate of 88.1% at 0.1% false accept rate. Further experiments show that our preprocessing method outperforms several existing preprocessors for a range of feature sets, data sets and lighting conditions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2042645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411802","Face recognition;illumination invariance;image preprocessing;kernel principal components analysis;local binary patterns;visual features","Face recognition;Lighting;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Pattern recognition;Histograms;Wavelet transforms;Noise robustness;Kernel;Wavelet analysis","Algorithms;Biometry;Face;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lighting;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","1704","18","53","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This structure is obtained by systematically nesting two or more uniform linear arrays and can provide $O(N^{2})$ degrees of freedom using only $N$  physical sensors when the second-order statistics of the received data is used. The concept of nesting is shown to be easily extensible to multiple stages and the structure of the optimally nested array is found analytically. It is possible to provide closed form expressions for the sensor locations and the exact degrees of freedom obtainable from the proposed array as a function of the total number of sensors. This cannot be done for existing classes of arrays like minimum redundancy arrays which have been used earlier for detecting more sources than the number of physical sensors. In minimum-input–minimum-output (MIMO) radar, the degrees of freedom are increased by constructing a longer virtual array through active sensing. The method proposed here, however, does not require active sensing and is capable of providing increased degrees of freedom in a completely passive setting. To utilize the degrees of freedom of the nested co-array, a novel spatial smoothing based approach to DOA estimation is also proposed, which does not require the inherent assumptions of the traditional techniques based on fourth-order cumulants or quasi stationary signals. As another potential application of the nested array, a new approach to beamforming based on a nonlinear preprocessing is also introduced, which can effectively utilize the degrees of freedom offered by the nested arrays. The usefulness of all the proposed methods is verified through extensive computer simulations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2049264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456168","Beamforming;co-array;direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;Khatri Rao product;minimum redundancy array;nested arrays;spatial smoothing","Array signal processing;Sensor arrays;Geometry;Sensor systems;Statistics;Radar detection;MIMO;Smoothing methods;Direction of arrival estimation;Application software","","1549","5","33","IEEE","29 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These two quantities are not yet available globally or with adequate temporal or spatial sampling. It is recognized that a spaceborne L-band radiometer with a suitable antenna is the most promising way of fulfilling this gap. With these scientific objectives and technical solution at the heart of a proposed mission concept the European Space Agency (ESA) selected the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission as its second Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission. The development of the SMOS mission was led by ESA in collaboration with the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in France and the Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) in Spain. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer operating in the 1400-1427-MHz protected band . The instrument receives the radiation emitted from Earth's surface, which can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil over land, and to salinity in the surface waters of the oceans. SMOS will achieve an unprecedented maximum spatial resolution of 50 km at L-band over land (43 km on average over the field of view), providing multiangular dual polarized (or fully polarized) brightness temperatures over the globe. SMOS has a revisit time of less than 3 days so as to retrieve soil moisture and ocean salinity data, meeting the mission's science objectives. The caveat in relation to its sampling requirements is that SMOS will have a somewhat reduced sensitivity when compared to conventional radiometers. The SMOS satellite was launched successfully on November 2, 2009.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2043032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5446359","Interferometry;L-band;sea surface salinity (SSS);soil moisture;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS);vegetation water content","SMOS mission;Monitoring;L-band;Radiometry;Sampling methods;Earth;Land surface;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Polarization","","1522","","95","IEEE","12 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The center pixels represent the image gray level and they are converted into a binary code, namely CLBP-Center (CLBP_C), by global thresholding. LDSMT decomposes the image local differences into two complementary components: the signs and the magnitudes, and two operators, namely CLBP-Sign (CLBP_S) and CLBP-Magnitude (CLBP_M), are proposed to code them. The traditional LBP is equivalent to the CLBP_S part of CLBP, and we show that CLBP_S preserves more information of the local structure than CLBP_M, which explains why the simple LBP operator can extract the texture features reasonably well. By combining CLBP_S, CLBP_M, and CLBP_C features into joint or hybrid distributions, significant improvement can be made for rotation invariant texture classification.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2044957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5427137","Local binary pattern (LBP);rotation invariance;texture classification","Pixel;Computer vision;Pattern recognition;Histograms;Face recognition;Image converters;Binary codes;Data mining;Feature extraction;Statistical analysis","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1487","4","26","IEEE","8 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, they can provide end users with the opportunity to reduce their electricity expenditures by responding to pricing that varies with different times of the day. However, recent studies have revealed that the lack of knowledge among users about how to respond to time-varying prices as well as the lack of effective building automation systems are two major barriers for fully utilizing the potential benefits of real-time pricing tariffs. We tackle these problems by proposing an optimal and automatic residential energy consumption scheduling framework which attempts to achieve a desired trade-off between minimizing the electricity payment and minimizing the waiting time for the operation of each appliance in household in presence of a real-time pricing tariff combined with inclining block rates. Our design requires minimum effort from the users and is based on simple linear programming computations. Moreover, we argue that any residential load control strategy in real-time electricity pricing environments requires price prediction capabilities. This is particularly true if the utility companies provide price information only one or two hours ahead of time. By applying a simple and efficient weighted average price prediction filter to the actual hourly-based price values used by the Illinois Power Company from January 2007 to December 2009, we obtain the optimal choices of the coefficients for each day of the week to be used by the price predictor filter. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed energy consumption scheduling design and the price predictor filter leads to significant reduction not only in users' payments but also in the resulting peak-to-average ratio in load demand for various load scenarios. Therefore, the deployment of the proposed optimal energy consumption scheduling schemes is beneficial for both end users and utility companies.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2010.2055903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540263","Energy consumption scheduling;inclining block rates;price prediction;real-time pricing;wholesale electricity market","Load flow control;Pricing;Energy consumption;Filters;Power generation economics;Economic forecasting;Environmental economics;Time varying systems;Automation;Real time systems","","1464","4","36","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In conventional level set formulations, the level set function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution. Therefore, a numerical remedy, called reinitialization, is typically applied to periodically replace the degraded level set function with a signed distance function. However, the practice of reinitialization not only raises serious problems as when and how it should be performed, but also affects numerical accuracy in an undesirable way. This paper proposes a new variational level set formulation in which the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically maintained during the level set evolution. The level set evolution is derived as the gradient flow that minimizes an energy functional with a distance regularization term and an external energy that drives the motion of the zero level set toward desired locations. The distance regularization term is defined with a potential function such that the derived level set evolution has a unique forward-and-backward (FAB) diffusion effect, which is able to maintain a desired shape of the level set function, particularly a signed distance profile near the zero level set. This yields a new type of level set evolution called distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE). The distance regularization effect eliminates the need for reinitialization and thereby avoids its induced numerical errors. In contrast to complicated implementations of conventional level set formulations, a simpler and more efficient finite difference scheme can be used to implement the DRLSE formulation. DRLSE also allows the use of more general and efficient initialization of the level set function. In its numerical implementation, relatively large time steps can be used in the finite difference scheme to reduce the number of iterations, while ensuring sufficient numerical accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLSE formulation, we apply it to an edge-based active contour model for image segmentation, and provide a simple narrowband implementation to greatly reduce computational cost.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2069690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557813","Forward and backward diffusion;image segmentation;level set method;narrowband;reinitialization","Level set;Equations;Active contours;Image segmentation;Mathematical model;Narrowband;Computational modeling","Image Enhancement;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated","1437","9","34","IEEE","26 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations [1]. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674368","Corner detection;feature detection.;Corner detection;feature detection","Machine learning;Detectors;Image edge detection;Computer vision;Layout;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Testing;Image matching;Image recognition;Streaming media","","1412","58","105","IEEE","17 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Application scenarios include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network. For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a single node failure is for a new node to reconstruct the whole encoded data object to generate just one encoded block. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to communicate functions of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal tradeoff.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2054295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5550492","Distributed storage;network coding;peer-to-peer storage;regenerating codes","Network coding;Peer to peer computing;Redundancy;Bandwidth;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless networks;Communication system control;Computer science;Statistics","","1356","60","40","IEEE","16 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When examples of one class in a training data set vastly outnumber examples of the other class(es), traditional data mining algorithms tend to create suboptimal classification models. Several techniques have been used to alleviate the problem of class imbalance, including data sampling and boosting. In this paper, we present a new hybrid sampling/boosting algorithm, called RUSBoost, for learning from skewed training data. This algorithm provides a simpler and faster alternative to SMOTEBoost, which is another algorithm that combines boosting and data sampling. This paper evaluates the performances of RUSBoost and SMOTEBoost, as well as their individual components (random undersampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and AdaBoost). We conduct experiments using 15 data sets from various application domains, four base learners, and four evaluation metrics. RUSBoost and SMOTEBoost both outperform the other procedures, and RUSBoost performs comparably to (and often better than) SMOTEBoost while being a simpler and faster technique. Given these experimental results, we highly recommend RUSBoost as an attractive alternative for improving the classification performance of learners built using imbalanced data.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2029559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299216","Binary classification;boosting;class imbalance;RUSBoost;sampling","Training data;Sampling methods;Boosting;Data mining;Computer science;Performance evaluation;Costs;Humans","","1352","2","37","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Energy-storage devices charge during low power demands and discharge during high power demands, acting as catalysts to provide energy boost. Batteries are the primary energy-storage devices in ground vehicles. Increasing the AER of vehicles by 15% almost doubles the incremental cost of the ESS. This is due to the fact that the ESS of HEVs requires higher peak power while preserving high energy density. Ultracapacitors (UCs) are the options with higher power densities in comparison with batteries.

In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of k-fold cross validation.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342427","k-fold cross validation;prediction error;error estimation;bias and variance;decomposition of the variance;sources of sensitivity;supervised classification.","Sensitivity analysis;Error analysis;Probability distribution;Training data;Testing;Machine learning;Analysis of variance;Nearest neighbor searches;Random variables;Estimation error","","1280","","28","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible, but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful. This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n).","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2044061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452187","Duality in optimization;free probability;low-rank matrices;matrix completion;nuclear norm minimization;random matrices and techniques from random matrix theory;semidefinite programming","Collaboration;Mathematics;Associate members;Minimization methods;Signal processing;Information filtering;Information filters;Motion pictures","","1277","3","17","IEEE","19 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204091","Image/video retrieval;evaluation/methodology;color;invariants;pattern recognition.","Layout;Lighting;Image recognition;Taxonomy;Photometry;Image color analysis;Benchmark testing;Robustness;Video sharing;Feature extraction","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Color;Colorimetry;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1264","21","43","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of taking periodic samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K)) measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant signal models-wavelet trees and block sparsity-into two state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M = O(K) measurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and applicability of our new theory and algorithms.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2040894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437428","Block sparsity;compressive sensing;signal model;sparsity;union of subspaces;wavelet tree","Image coding;Robustness;Sampling methods;Costs;Transform coding;Greedy algorithms;Measurement standards;Concrete;Guidelines;Sufficient conditions","","1156","12","49","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they are hampered by wireless channel conditions: absent feedback, they are typically feasible only when the source-destination channel is better than the source-eavesdropper channel. Node cooperation is a means to overcome this challenge and improve the performance of secure wireless communications. This paper addresses secure communications of one source-destination pair with the help of multiple cooperating relays in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers. Three cooperative schemes are considered: decode-and-forward (DF), amplify-and-forward (AF), and cooperative jamming (CJ). For these schemes, the relays transmit a weighted version of a reencoded noise-free message signal (for DF), a received noisy source signal (for AF), or a common jamming signal (for CJ). Novel system designs are proposed, consisting of the determination of relay weights and the allocation of transmit power, that maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to a transmit power constraint, or, minimize the transmit power subject to a secrecy rate constraint. For DF in the presence of one eavesdropper, closed-form optimal solutions are derived for the relay weights. For other problems, since the optimal relay weights are difficult to obtain, several criteria are considered leading to suboptimal but simple solutions, i.e., the complete nulling of the message signals at all eavesdroppers (for DF and AF), or the complete nulling of jamming signal at the destination (for CJ). Based on the designed relay weights, for DF in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers, and for CJ in the presence of one eavesdropper, the optimal power allocation is obtained in closed-form; in all other cases the optimal power allocation is obtained via iterative algorithms. Numerical evaluation of the obtained secrecy rate and transmit power results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the performance of secure wireless communications.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2038412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352243","Cooperation;distributed wireless systems;physical layer security;relaying;secrecy rate","Communication system security;Physical layer;Relays;Wireless communication;Jamming;Data security;Power system relaying;Cryptography;Feedback;Decoding","","1150","","41","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations.

In this paper, a methodology has been proposed for optimally allocating different types of renewable distributed generation (DG) units in the distribution system so as to minimize annual energy loss. The methodology is based on generating a probabilistic generation-load model that combines all possible operating conditions of the renewable DG units with their probabilities, hence accommodating this model in a deterministic planning problem. The planning problem is formulated as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), with an objective function for minimizing the system's annual energy losses. The constraints include the voltage limits, the feeders' capacity, the maximum penetration limit, and the discrete size of the available DG units. This proposed technique has been applied to a typical rural distribution system with different scenarios, including all possible combinations of the renewable DG units.

This yields much better results in wide-baseline situations than the pixel and correlation-based algorithms that are commonly used in narrow-baseline stereo. Also, using a descriptor makes our algorithm robust against many photometric and geometric transformations. Our descriptor is inspired from earlier ones such as SIFT and GLOH but can be computed much faster for our purposes. Unlike SURF, which can also be computed efficiently at every pixel, it does not introduce artifacts that degrade the matching performance when used densely.

This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form, the problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries. It comes up in many areas of science and engineering, including collaborative filtering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision, to name a few. This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows that under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix from a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints. Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is provably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small amount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown matrix of low rank from just about log noisy samples with an error that is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results that complement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear-norm minimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix completion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454406","Compressed sensing;duality in optimization;low-rank matrices;matrix completion;nuclear-norm minimization;oracle inequalities;semidefinite programming","Motion pictures;Compressed sensing;Linear matrix inequalities;Noise level;Frequency;Collaboration;Filtering;Machine learning;Remote sensing;Computer vision","","1065","8","35","IEEE","26 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The same condition on block-coherence is shown to guarantee successful recovery through a mixed -optimization approach. This complements previous recovery results for the block-sparse case which relied on small block-restricted isometry constants. The significance of the results presented in this paper lies in the fact that making explicit use of block-sparsity can provably yield better reconstruction properties than treating the signal as being sparse in the conventional sense, thereby ignoring the additional structure in the problem.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2044837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5424069","Basis pursuit;block-sparsity;compressed sensing;matching pursuit","Uncertainty;Matching pursuit algorithms;Pursuit algorithms;Equations;Clustering algorithms;Compressed sensing;Vectors;Sparse matrices;Wireless communication","","1024","1","48","IEEE","4 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, the choice of the dictionary that sparsifies the signals is crucial for the success of this model. In general, the choice of a proper dictionary can be done using one of two ways: i) building a sparsifying dictionary based on a mathematical model of the data, or ii) learning a dictionary to perform best on a training set. In this paper we describe the evolution of these two paradigms. As manifestations of the first approach, we cover topics such as wavelets, wavelet packets, contourlets, and curvelets, all aiming to exploit 1-D and 2-D mathematical models for constructing effective dictionaries for signals and images.

This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer.

The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that “classical” flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539939","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539939","","Image motion analysis;Optical filters;Filtering;Optimization methods;Performance gain;Robustness;Sun;Data flow computing;Art","","940","19","41","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.","1941-1197","","10.1109/MITS.2010.939925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681215","","Tutorials;Graph theory;Mobile robots;Global Positioning System;Mapping","","938","56","33","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of blind sub-Nyquist sampling of multiband signals, whose unknown frequency support occupies only a small portion of a wide spectrum. Our primary design goals are efficient hardware implementation and low computational load on the supporting digital processing. We propose a system, named the modulated wideband converter, which first multiplies the analog signal by a bank of periodic waveforms. The product is then low-pass filtered and sampled uniformly at a low rate, which is orders of magnitude smaller than Nyquist. Perfect recovery from the proposed samples is achieved under certain necessary and sufficient conditions. We also develop a digital architecture, which allows either reconstruction of the analog input, or processing of any band of interest at a low rate, that is, without interpolating to the high Nyquist rate. Numerical simulations demonstrate many engineering aspects: robustness to noise and mismodeling, potential hardware simplifications, real-time performance for signals with time-varying support and stability to quantization effects. We compare our system with two previous approaches: periodic nonuniform sampling, which is bandwidth limited by existing hardware devices, and the random demodulator, which is restricted to discrete multitone signals and has a high computational load. In the broader context of Nyquist sampling, our scheme has the potential to break through the bandwidth barrier of state-of-the-art analog conversion technologies such as interleaved converters.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419072","Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC);compressive sampling (CS);infinite measurement vectors (IMV);multiband sampling;spectrum-blind reconstruction;sub-Nyquist sampling","Sampling methods;Wideband;Hardware;Robust stability;Bandwidth;Signal sampling;Frequency;Low pass filters;Sufficient conditions;Numerical simulation","","922","31","44","IEEE","22 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using this type of power-synchronization control, the VSC avoids the instability caused by a standard phase-locked loop in a weak AC-system connection. Moreover, a VSC terminal can give the weak ac system strong voltage support, just like a normal synchronous machine does.

Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2010.2048257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5512826","","Information technology;Urban areas;Smart buildings;Decision making;Intelligent structures;Structural engineering","","886","1","40","IBM","19 Jul 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Traditional training-based channel estimation methods, typically comprising linear reconstruction techniques, are known to be optimal for rich multipath channels. However, physical arguments and growing experimental evidence suggest that many wireless channels encountered in practice tend to exhibit a sparse multipath structure that gets pronounced as the signal space dimension gets large (e.g., due to large bandwidth or large number of antennas). In this paper, we formalize the notion of multipath sparsity and present a new approach to estimating sparse (or effectively sparse) multipath channels that is based on some of the recent advances in the theory of compressed sensing. In particular, it is shown in the paper that the proposed approach, which is termed as compressed channel sensing (CCS), can potentially achieve a target reconstruction error using far less energy and, in many instances, latency and bandwidth than that dictated by the traditional least-squares-based training methods.

The major characteristic of FLICM is the use of a fuzzy local (both spatial and gray level) similarity measure, aiming to guarantee noise insensitiveness and image detail preservation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is fully free of the empirically adjusted parameters ($a$, $\lambda_{g}$, $\lambda_{s}$, etc.) incorporated into all other fuzzy c-means algorithms proposed in the literature.

As promising as it is, this paradigm also brings forth many new challenges for data security and access control when users outsource sensitive data for sharing on cloud servers, which are not within the same trusted domain as data owners. To keep sensitive user data confidential against untrusted servers, existing solutions usually apply cryptographic methods by disclosing data decryption keys only to authorized users. However, in doing so, these solutions inevitably introduce a heavy computation overhead on the data owner for key distribution and data management when fine-grained data access control is desired, and thus do not scale well. The problem of simultaneously achieving fine-grainedness, scalability, and data confidentiality of access control actually still remains unresolved. This paper addresses this challenging open issue by, on one hand, defining and enforcing access policies based on data attributes, and, on the other hand, allowing the data owner to delegate most of the computation tasks involved in fine-grained data access control to untrusted cloud servers without disclosing the underlying data contents. We achieve this goal by exploiting and uniquely combining techniques of attribute-based encryption (ABE), proxy re-encryption, and lazy re-encryption. Our proposed scheme also has salient properties of user access privilege confidentiality and user secret key accountability. Extensive analysis shows that our proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure under existing security models.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462174","","Access control;Cloud computing;Medical services;Data security;Business;Web and internet services;Web server;Cryptography;Service oriented architecture;Memory","","878","162","22","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our algorithm is based on a visual tracking decomposition scheme for the efficient design of observation and motion models as well as trackers. In our scheme, the observation model is decomposed into multiple basic observation models that are constructed by sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) of a set of feature templates. Each basic observation model covers a specific appearance of the object. The motion model is also represented by the combination of multiple basic motion models, each of which covers a different type of motion. Then the multiple basic trackers are designed by associating the basic observation models and the basic motion models, so that each specific tracker takes charge of a certain change in the object. All basic trackers are then integrated into one compound tracker through an interactive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (IMCMC) framework in which the basic trackers communicate with one another interactively while run in parallel. By exchanging information with others, each tracker further improves its performance, which results in increasing the whole performance of tracking. Experimental results show that our method tracks the object accurately and reliably in realistic videos where the appearance and motion are drastically changing over time.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539821","","Robustness;Videos;Target tracking;Lighting;Algorithm design and analysis;Principal component analysis;Monte Carlo methods;Computer vision;Photometry;Fuses","","877","1","20","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

By ensuring boundedness of the BLF, we actively constrain the argument of the unknown functions to remain within a compact superset such that the NN approximation conditions hold. The semiglobal boundedness of all closed-loop signals is ensured, and the tracking error converges to a neighborhood of zero.

We propose a method to learn an over-complete dictionary that attempts to simultaneously achieve the above two goals. The proposed method, discriminative K-SVD (D-KSVD), is based on extending the K-SVD algorithm by incorporating the classification error into the objective function, thus allowing the performance of a linear classifier and the representational power of the dictionary being considered at the same time by the same optimization procedure. The D-KSVD algorithm finds the dictionary and solves for the classifier using a procedure derived from the K-SVD algorithm, which has proven efficiency and performance. This is in contrast to most existing work that relies on iteratively solving sub-problems with the hope of achieving the global optimal through iterative approximation. We evaluate the proposed method using two commonly-used face databases, the Extended YaleB database and the AR database, with detailed comparison to 3 alternative approaches, including the leading state-of-the-art in the literature. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms these competing methods in most of the cases. Further, using Fisher criterion and dictionary incoherence, we also show that the learned dictionary and the corresponding classifier are indeed better-posed to support sparse-representation-based recognition.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539989","","Dictionaries;Face recognition;Databases;Iterative algorithms;Image coding;Optimization methods;Image recognition;Computer vision;Face detection;Feature extraction","","845","2","23","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inverse problem is solved using the least-squares method and the decision is ruled in favor of the class with the minimum reconstruction error. The proposed Linear Regression Classification (LRC) algorithm falls in the category of nearest subspace classification. The algorithm is extensively evaluated on several standard databases under a number of exemplary evaluation protocols reported in the face recognition literature.

In many applications, however, sampling at the Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a small number of significant frequencies relative to the band limit, although the locations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse signal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type of data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed from robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of frequencies in the signal, and let W denote its band limit in hertz. Simulations suggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per second to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially lower than the Nyquist rate of W hertz. In contrast to Nyquist sampling, one must use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal from the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the empirical observations.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2034811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361485","Analog-to-digital conversion;compressive sampling;sampling theory;signal recovery;sparse approximation","Sampling methods;Frequency;Demodulation;Signal sampling;Signal processing;Hardware;Data acquisition;Robustness;Performance analysis","","832","28","67","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, detailed knowledge and comparisons between different electrodes are not well known in the literature. In this paper, we explore the use of dry/noncontact electrodes for clinical use by first explaining the electrical models for dry, insulated and noncontact electrodes and show the performance limits, along with measured data. The theory and data show that the common practice of minimizing electrode resistance may not always be necessary and actually lead to increased noise depending on coupling capacitance.

While most of the microgrids adopt ac distribution as well as conventional power systems, dc microgrids are proposed and researched for the good connection with dc output type sources such as photovoltaic (PV) system, fuel cell, and secondary battery. Moreover, if loads in the system are supplied with dc power, the conversion losses from sources to loads are reduced compared with ac microgrid. As one of the dc microgrids, we propose “low-voltage bipolar-type dc microgrid,” which can supply super high quality power with three-wire dc distribution line. In this paper, one system for a residential complex is presented as an instance of the dc microgrid. In this system, each house has a cogeneration system (CGS) such as gas engine and fuel cell.

It is based on the fact that human perception of a pattern depends not only on the change of a stimulus (such as sound, lighting) but also on the original intensity of the stimulus. Specifically, WLD consists of two components: differential excitation and orientation. The differential excitation component is a function of the ratio between two terms: One is the relative intensity differences of a current pixel against its neighbors, the other is the intensity of the current pixel. The orientation component is the gradient orientation of the current pixel. For a given image, we use the two components to construct a concatenated WLD histogram. Experimental results on the Brodatz and KTH-TIPS2-a texture databases show that WLD impressively outperforms the other widely used descriptors (e.g., Gabor and SIFT). In addition, experimental results on human face detection also show a promising performance comparable to the best known results on the MIT+CMU frontal face test set, the AR face data set, and the CMU profile test set.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204092","Pattern recognition;Weber law;local descriptor;texture;face detection.","Robustness;Face detection;Image edge detection;Histograms;Humans;Testing;Face recognition;Pixel;Image motion analysis;Image texture analysis","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique","813","4","53","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The $n^{th}$-order LDP is proposed to encode the $(n-1)^{th}$ -order local derivative direction variations, which can capture more detailed information than the first-order local pattern used in local binary pattern (LBP). Different from LBP encoding the relationship between the central point and its neighbors, the LDP templates extract high-order local information by encoding various distinctive spatial relationships contained in a given local region. Both gray-level images and Gabor feature images are used to evaluate the comparative performances of LDP and LBP. Extensive experimental results on FERET, CAS-PEAL, CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and FRGC databases show that the high-order LDP consistently performs much better than LBP for both face identification and face verification under various conditions.

One limitation originates from mismatch of granularities between the client layer and the wavelength layer. The recently proposed spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE) is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. This article discusses another limitation of the current optical networks associated with worst case design in terms of transmission performance. In order to address this problem, we present a concept of a novel adaptation scheme in SLICE called distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation. In the presented scheme the minimum necessary spectral resource is adaptively allocated according to the end-to-end physical condition of an optical path. Modulation format and optical filter width are used as parameters to determine the necessary spectral resources to be allocated for an optical path. Evaluation of network utilization efficiency shows that distance-adaptive SLICE can save more than 45 percent of required spectrum resources for a 12-node ring network. Finally, we introduce the concept of a frequency slot to extend the current frequency grid standard, and discuss possible spectral resource designation schemes.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2010.5534599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534599","","Resource management;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber communication;Optical filters;Optical modulation;Optical receivers;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors;Optical design;Frequency","","789","15","10","IEEE","3 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The accuracy of GQI was evaluated by a simulation study and an in vivo experiment in comparison with QBI and DSI. The simulation results showed that the accuracy of GQI was comparable to that of QBI and DSI. The simulation study of GQI also showed that an anisotropy index, named quantitative anisotropy, was correlated with the volume fraction of the resolved fiber component. The in vivo images of GQI demonstrated that SDF patterns were similar to the ODFs reconstructed by QBI or DSI. The tractography generated from GQI was also similar to those generated from QBI and DSI.

In this paper we present a general framework that incorporates communication constraints, varying transmission intervals and varying delays. Based on a newly developed NCS model including all these network phenomena, we will provide an explicit construction of a continuum of Lyapunov functions. Based on this continuum of Lyapunov functions we will derive bounds on the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI) and the maximally allowable delay (MAD) that guarantee stability of the NCS in the presence of communication constraints. The developed theory includes recently improved results for delay-free NCS as a special case. After considering stability, we also study semi-global practical stability (under weaker conditions) and performance of the NCS in terms of Lp gains from disturbance inputs to controlled outputs. The developed results lead to tradeoff curves between MATI, MAD and performance gains that depend on the used protocol. These tradeoff curves provide quantitative information that supports the network designer when selecting appropriate networks and protocols guaranteeing stability and a desirable level of performance, while being robust to specified variations in delays and transmission intervals. The complete design procedure will be illustrated using a benchmark example.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2010.2042352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5409530"," ${\cal L}_{p}$ gains;communication constraints;delays;Lyapunov functions;networked control systems (NCS);protocols;stability;time scheduling","Networked control systems;Lyapunov method;Performance gain;Protocols;Robust stability;Delay effects;Sampling methods;Propagation losses;Quantization;Communication system control","","762","","56","IEEE","8 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This leads to reconstructed images with strong aliasing. We make four contributions in this paper: 1) we present a comprehensive optimization method to arrive at the spatial and spectral layout of the color filter array of a GAP camera. 2) We develop a novel algorithm for reconstructing the under-sampled channels of the image while minimizing aliasing artifacts. 3) We demonstrate how the user can capture a single image and then control the tradeoff of spatial resolution to generate a variety of images, including monochrome, high dynamic range (HDR) monochrome, RGB, HDR RGB, and multispectral images. 4) Finally, the performance of our GAP camera has been verified using extensive simulations that use multispectral images of real world scenes.

The major challenge of PPSs is the development of reliable on-board pedestrian detection systems. Due to the varying appearance of pedestrians (e.g., different clothes, changing size, aspect ratio, and dynamic shape) and the unstructured environment, it is very difficult to cope with the demanded robustness of this kind of system. Two problems arising in this research area are the lack of public benchmarks and the difficulty in reproducing many of the proposed methods, which makes it difficult to compare the approaches. As a result, surveying the literature by enumerating the proposals one--after-another is not the most useful way to provide a comparative point of view. Accordingly, we present a more convenient strategy to survey the different approaches. We divide the problem of detecting pedestrians from images into different processing steps, each with attached responsibilities. Then, the different proposed methods are analyzed and classified with respect to each processing stage, favoring a comparative viewpoint. Finally, discussion of the important topics is presented, putting special emphasis on the future needs and challenges.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010438","ADAS;pedestrian detection;on-board vision;survey.","Protection;Vehicle dynamics;Automobiles;Road accidents;Vehicle safety;Vehicle driving;Vehicles;Shape;Robustness;Proposals","Accident Prevention;Accident Prevention;Accidents, Traffic;Automobile Driving;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Walking","756","14","146","IEEE","29 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462173","","Memory;Data security;Cloud computing;Computer vision;Outsourcing;Protection;Physics computing;Data privacy;Public key;Aggregates","","751","10","23","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

LTE Release 8, which is mainly deployed in a macro/microcell layout, provides improved system capacity and coverage, high peak data rates, low latency, reduced operating costs, multi-antenna support, flexible bandwidth operation and seamless integration with existing systems. LTE-Advanced (also known as LTE Release 10) significantly enhances the existing LTE Release 8 and supports much higher peak rates, higher throughput and coverage, and lower latencies, resulting in a better user experience. Additionally, LTE Release 10 will support heterogeneous deployments where low-power nodes comprising picocells, femtocells, relays, remote radio heads, and so on are placed in a macrocell layout. The LTE-Advanced features enable one to meet or exceed IMT-Advanced requirements. It may also be noted that LTE Release 9 provides some minor enhancement to LTE Release 8 with respect to the air interface, and includes features like dual-layer beamforming and time-difference- of-arrival-based location techniques.

The underlying idea is to learn a map from input low-resolution images to target high-resolution images based on example pairs of input and output images. Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is adopted for this purpose. To reduce the time complexity of training and testing for KRR, a sparse solution is found by combining the ideas of kernel matching pursuit and gradient descent. As a regularized solution, KRR leads to a better generalization than simply storing the examples as has been done in existing example-based algorithms and results in much less noisy images. However, this may introduce blurring and ringing artifacts around major edges as sharp changes are penalized severely. A prior model of a generic image class which takes into account the discontinuity property of images is adopted to resolve this problem.

Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613452","Narrative visualization;storytelling;design methods;case study;journalism;social data analysis","Data visualization;Visualization;Media;Image color analysis;Engineering profession;Economics","","738","13","27","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a novel paradigm for training a binary classifier from labeled and unlabeled examples that we call P-N learning. The learning process is guided by positive (P) and negative (N) constraints which restrict the labeling of the unlabeled set. P-N learning evaluates the classifier on the unlabeled data, identifies examples that have been classified in contradiction with structural constraints and augments the training set with the corrected samples in an iterative process. We propose a theory that formulates the conditions under which P-N learning guarantees improvement of the initial classifier and validate it on synthetic and real data. P-N learning is applied to the problem of on-line learning of object detector during tracking. We show that an accurate object detector can be learned from a single example and an unlabeled video sequence where the object may occur. The algorithm is compared with related approaches and state-of-the-art is achieved on a variety of objects (faces, pedestrians, cars, motorbikes and animals).","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540231","","Object detection;Labeling;Detectors;Video sequences;Face detection;Motorcycles;Animals;Semisupervised learning;Computer vision;Video sharing","","734","8","24","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of major smart grid resources such as renewables, demand response, and storage. We observe that an ideal mix of these resources leads to a flatter net demand that eventually accentuates reliability challenges further.

"A Novel Multiresolution Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Model and Its Applications in Image and Video Compression","C. Guo; L. Zhang","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA; Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China",IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,"15 Dec 2009","2010","19","1","185","198","Salient areas in natural scenes are generally regarded as areas which the human eye will typically focus on, and finding these areas is the key step in object detection. In computer vision, many models have been proposed to simulate the behavior of eyes such as SaliencyToolBox (STB), Neuromorphic Vision Toolkit (NVT), and others, but they demand high computational cost and computing useful results mostly relies on their choice of parameters. Although some region-based approaches were proposed to reduce the computational complexity of feature maps, these approaches still were not able to work in real time. Recently, a simple and fast approach called spectral residual (SR) was proposed, which uses the SR of the amplitude spectrum to calculate the image's saliency map. However, in our previous work, we pointed out that it is the phase spectrum, not the amplitude spectrum, of an image's Fourier transform that is key to calculating the location of salient areas, and proposed the phase spectrum of Fourier transform (PFT) model. In this paper, we present a quaternion representation of an image which is composed of intensity, color, and motion features. Based on the principle of PFT, a novel multiresolution spatiotemporal saliency detection model called phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT) is proposed in this paper to calculate the spatiotemporal saliency map of an image by its quaternion representation. Distinct from other models, the added motion dimension allows the phase spectrum to represent spatiotemporal saliency in order to perform attention selection not only for images but also for videos. In addition, the PQFT model can compute the saliency map of an image under various resolutions from coarse to fine. Therefore, the hierarchical selectivity (HS) framework based on the PQFT model is introduced here to construct the tree structure representation of an image. With the help of HS, a model called multiresolution wavelet domain foveation (MWDF) is proposed in this paper to improve coding efficiency in image and video compression. Extensive tests of videos, natural images, and psychological patterns show that the proposed PQFT model is more effective in saliency detection and can predict eye fixations better than other state-of-the-art models in previous literature. Moreover, our model requires low computational cost and, therefore, can work in real time. Additional experiments on image and video compression show that the HS-MWDF model can achieve higher compression rate than the traditional model.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2030969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223506","Hierarchical selectivity (HS);multiresolution wavelet domain foveation (MWDF);phase spectrum of Fourier transform (PFT);phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT);receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve;spatiotemporal saliency map;visual attention","Image resolution;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Video compression;Fourier transforms;Quaternions;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Computational efficiency;Strontium;Image coding","","719","4","56","IEEE","25 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each subscriber is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) unit as part of its smart meter. Each smart meter is connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure such as a local area network. This allows two-way communication among smart meters. Considering the importance of energy pricing as an essential tool to develop efficient demand side management strategies, we propose a novel real-time pricing algorithm for the future smart grid. We focus on the interactions between the smart meters and the energy provider through the exchange of control messages which contain subscribers' energy consumption and the real-time price information. First, we analytically model the subscribers' preferences and their energy consumption patterns in form of carefully selected utility functions based on concepts from microeconomics. Second, we propose a distributed algorithm which automatically manages the interactions among the ECC units at the smart meters and the energy provider. The algorithm finds the optimal energy consumption levels for each subscriber to maximize the aggregate utility of all subscribers in the system in a fair and efficient fashion. Finally, we show that the energy provider can encourage some desirable consumption patterns among the subscribers by means of the proposed real-time pricing interactions.

The effect of the surface resistance of the FSS and dielectric substrate characteristics on the input impedance of the absorber is discussed by means of a circuital model. It is shown that the optimum value of surface resistance is affected both by substrate parameters (thickness and permittivity) and by FSS element shape.

The global model description consists of all model point pair features and represents a mapping from the point pair feature space to the model, where similar features on the model are grouped together. Such representation allows using much sparser object and scene point clouds, resulting in very fast performance. Recognition is done locally using an efficient voting scheme on a reduced two-dimensional search space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and show its high recognition performance in the case of noise, clutter and partial occlusions.

While Moore's law continues to provide additional transistors, power budgets have begun to prohibit those devices from actually being used. To reduce energy consumption, voltage scaling techniques have proved a popular technique with subthreshold design representing the endpoint of voltage scaling. Although it is extremely energy efficient, subthreshold design has been relegated to niche markets due to its major performance penalties. This paper defines and explores near-threshold computing (NTC), a design space where the supply voltage is approximately equal to the threshold voltage of the transistors. This region retains much of the energy savings of subthreshold operation with more favorable performance and variability characteristics. This makes it applicable to a broad range of power-constrained computing segments from sensors to high performance servers.

Recent developments offer exciting possibilities in personalized medicine provided a truly integrated approach, combining chemistry, materials science, physics, engineering, biology and medicine, is implemented. Emphasizing this perspective, here we address important issues for the rapid development of the field, i.e., magnetic behavior at the nanoscale with emphasis on the relaxation dynamics, synthesis and surface functionalization of nanoparticles and core-shell structures, biocompatibility and toxicity studies, biological constraints and opportunities, and in vivo and in vitro applications. Specifically, we discuss targeted drug delivery and triggered release, novel contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, cancer therapy using magnetic fluid hyperthermia, in vitro diagnostics and the emerging magnetic particle imaging technique, that is quantitative and sensitive enough to compete with established imaging methods. In addition, the physics of self-assembly, which is fundamental to both biology and the future development of nanoscience, is illustrated with magnetic nanoparticles. It is shown that various competing energies associated with self-assembly converge on the nanometer length scale and different assemblies can be tailored by varying particle size and size distribution.

Our experimental results further show that if the self-interference is cancelled in the analog domain before the interfering signal reaches the receiver front end, then the resulting full-duplex system can achieve rates higher than the rates achieved by a half-duplex system with identical analog resources.","1058-6393","978-1-4244-9721-8","10.1109/ACSSC.2010.5757799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5757799","","Antenna measurements;Wireless communication;Interference;Transmitting antennas;Variable speed drives;Radio frequency","","677","86","9","IEEE","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In optical emitters, its high exciton binding energy (60 meV) gives ZnO an edge over other semiconductors such as GaN if reproducible and reliable p-type doping in ZnO were to be achieved, which currently remains to be the main obstacle for realization of bipolar devices. On the electronic side, ZnO holds some potential in transparent thin film transistors (TFTs) owing to its high optical transmittivity and high conductivity. Among the other promising areas of application for ZnO are acoustic wave devices, due to large electromechanical coupling in ZnO, and devices utilizing nanowires/nanorods such as biosensors and gas sensors and solar cells, since it is relatively easy to produce such forms of ZnO nanostructures, which have good charge carrier transport properties and high crystalline quality. Despite the significant progress made, there is still a number of important issues that need to be resolved before ZnO can be transitioned to commercial use, not to mention the stiff competition it is facing with GaN, which is much more mature in terms of devices. In this paper, recent progress in device applications of ZnO is discussed and a review of critical issues for realization of ZnO-based devices is given.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2044550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462913","Distributed feedback lasers;light-emitting diodes (LEDs);nanostructure devices;thin film transistors (TFTs);transparent oxides;zinc oxide","Zinc oxide;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical films;Optical sensors;Gallium nitride;Thin film transistors;Optical materials;Semiconductor materials;Acoustic materials;Photonics","","676","1","80","IEEE","10 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Localization is commonly accomplished through the use of radio communication between mobile devices (agents) and fixed infrastructure (anchors). However, precise determination of agent positions is a challenging task, especially in harsh environments due to radio blockage or limited anchor deployment. In these situations, cooperation among agents can significantly improve localization accuracy and reduce localization outage probabilities. A general framework of analyzing the fundamental limits of wideband localization has been developed in Part I of the paper. Here, we build on this framework and establish the fundamental limits of wideband cooperative location-aware networks. Our analysis is based on the waveforms received at the nodes, in conjunction with Fisher information inequality. We provide a geometrical interpretation of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for cooperative networks. This approach allows us to succinctly derive fundamental performance limits and their scaling behaviors, and to treat anchors and agents in a unified way from the perspective of localization accuracy. Our results yield important insights into how and when cooperation is beneficial.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2059720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571889","Cooperative localization;Cramér–Rao bound (CRB);equivalent Fisher information (EFI);information inequality;ranging information (RI);squared position error bound (SPEB)","Wideband;Accuracy;Distance measurement;Joints;Global Positioning System","","676","2","53","IEEE","13 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In fact, viewed from transmission and wholesale operations, sometimes the term ¿virtual power plant¿ is used to refer to these resources. In the context of energy and ancillary service markets facilitated by the independent system operators (ISOs)/regional transmission organizations (RTOs), the market products DER/DR can offer may include energy, ancillary services, and/or capacity, depending on the ISO/RTO market design and applicable operational standards. In this paper we first explore the main industry drivers of smart grid and the different facets of DER under the smart grid paradigm. We then concentrate on DR and summarize the existing and evolving programs at different ISOs/RTOs and the product markets they can participate in.

We chose particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve the corresponding optimization problem because of its straightforward implementation and demonstrated ability to generate near-optimal schedules within manageable computation times. We improve the basic formulation of cooperative PSO by introducing stochastic repulsion among the particles. The improved DER schedules are then used to investigate the potential consumer value added by coordinated DER scheduling. This is computed by comparing the end-user costs obtained with the enhanced algorithm simultaneously scheduling all DER, against the costs when each DER schedule is solved separately. This comparison enables the end users to determine whether their mix of energy service needs, available DER and electricity tariff arrangements might warrant solving the more complex coordinated scheduling problem, or instead, decomposing the problem into multiple simpler optimizations.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2010.2053053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524053","Coevolutionary PSO;distributed energy resources;energy management;energy services;home automation;optimization methods;repulsive PSO;value of coordination","Energy resources;Smart homes;Density estimation robust algorithm;Processor scheduling;Costs;Scheduling algorithm;Energy management;Particle swarm optimization;Stochastic processes;Smart grids","","669","4","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to existing solutions that require changes in the network architecture and the routing protocols, this paper proposes using traffic-aware virtual machine (VM) placement to improve the network scalability. By optimizing the placement of VMs on host machines, traffic patterns among VMs can be better aligned with the communication distance between them, e.g. VMs with large mutual bandwidth usage are assigned to host machines in close proximity. We formulate the VM placement as an optimization problem and prove its hardness. We design a two-tier approximate algorithm that efficiently solves the VM placement problem for very large problem sizes. Given the significant difference in the traffic patterns seen in current data centers and the structural differences of the recently proposed data center architectures, we further conduct a comparative analysis on the impact of the traffic patterns and the network architectures on the potential performance gain of traffic-aware VM placement. We use traffic traces collected from production data centers to evaluate our proposed VM placement algorithm, and we show a significant performance improvement compared to existing general methods that do not take advantage of traffic patterns and data center network characteristics.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5461930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461930","","Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail;Routing protocols;Bandwidth;Algorithm design and analysis;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis","","666","172","27","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling.

"Feature Selection for Classification of Hyperspectral Data by SVM","M. Pal; G. M.

Here, a series of classification analyses with two hyperspectral sensor data sets reveals that the accuracy of a classification by an SVM does vary as a function of the number of features used. Critically, it is shown that the accuracy of a classification may decline significantly (at 0.05 level of statistical significance) with the addition of features, particularly if a small training sample is used. This highlights a dependence of the accuracy of classification by an SVM on the dimensionality of the data and, therefore, the potential value of undertaking a feature-selection analysis prior to classification. Additionally, it is demonstrated that, even when a large training sample is available, feature selection may still be useful. For example, the accuracy derived from the use of a small number of features may be noninferior (at 0.05 level of significance) to that derived from the use of a larger feature set providing potential advantages in relation to issues such as data storage and computational processing costs. Feature selection may, therefore, be a valuable analysis to include in preprocessing operations for classification by an SVM.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2039484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419028","Classification accuracy;feature selection;Hughes phenomenon;hyperspectral data;support vector machines (SVM)","Hyperspectral imaging;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Hyperspectral sensors;Educational institutions;Memory;Computational efficiency;Space technology;Infrared sensors;Infrared spectra","","632","1","67","IEEE","22 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our algorithm, partial hypotheses are pruned with a sequence of thresholds. In analogy to probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, we introduce the notion of probably approximately admissible (PAA) thresholds. Such thresholds provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the cascade method and can be computed from a small sample of positive examples. Finally, we outline a cascade detection algorithm for a general class of models defined by a grammar formalism. This class includes not only tree-structured pictorial structures but also richer models that can represent each part recursively as a mixture of other parts.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539906","","Object detection;Deformable models;Dynamic programming;Buildings;Detection algorithms;Testing;Training data;Visualization;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions","","631","13","16","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the type of the attributes considered in the morphological attribute transformation, different parametric features can be modeled. The generation of APs, thanks to an efficient implementation, strongly reduces the computational load required for the computation of conventional MPs. Moreover, the characterization of the image with different attributes leads to a more complete description of the scene and to a more accurate modeling of the spatial information than with the use of conventional morphological filters based on a predefined structuring element. Here, the features extracted by the proposed operators were used for the classification of two very high resolution panchromatic images acquired by Quickbird on the city of Trento, Italy. The experimental analysis proved the usefulness of APs in modeling the spatial information present in the images.

Quantitative relationships between QoE and QoS are required in order to be able to build effective QoE control mechanisms onto measurable QoS parameters. Against this background, this article proposes a generic formula in which QoE and QoS parameters are connected through an exponential relationship, called IQX hypothesis. The formula relates changes of QoE with respect to QoS to the current level of QoE, is simple to match, and its limit behaviors are straightforward to interpret. It validates the IQX hypothesis for streaming services, where QoE in terms of Mean Opinion Scores is expressed as functions of loss and reordering ratio, the latter of which is caused by jitter. For web surfing as the second application area, matchings provided by the IQX hypothesis are shown to outperform previously published logarithmic functions. We conclude that the IQX hypothesis is a strong candidate to be taken into account when deriving relationships between QoE and QoS parameters.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2010.5430142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5430142","","Quality of service;Testing;Jitter;Throughput;Monitoring;Delay effects;Image quality;Timing;Distortion measurement;Laboratories","","614","5","10","IEEE","15 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

As a contrast, we show that computing influence in directed a cyclic graphs (DAGs) can be done in time linear to the size of the graphs.

We conduct extensive simulations to show that our algorithm is scalable to networks with millions of nodes and edges, is orders of magnitude faster than the greedy approximation algorithm proposed by Kempe et al. and its optimized versions, and performs consistently among the best algorithms while other heuristic algorithms not design specifically for the linear threshold model have unstable performances on different real-world networks.","2374-8486","978-1-4244-9131-5","10.1109/ICDM.2010.118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693962","influence maximization;social networks;linear threshold model","Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Greedy algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Social network services;Heuristic algorithms","","600","1","20","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the method, first, the source image is represented with sparse coefficients using an overcomplete dictionary. Second, the coefficients are combined with the choose-max fusion rule. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed from the combined sparse coefficients and the dictionary.

Our main contribution is to relate the feasibility issue to the problem of determining the solvability of a multivariate polynomial system which is considered extensively in algebraic geometry. It is well known, e.g., from Bezout's theorem, that generic polynomial systems are solvable if and only if the number of equations does not exceed the number of variables. Following this intuition, we classify signal space interference alignment problems as either proper or improper based on the number of equations and variables. Rigorous connections between feasible and proper systems are made through Bernshtein's theorem for the case where each transmitter uses only one beamforming vector. The multibeam case introduces dependencies among the coefficients of a polynomial system so that the system is no longer generic in the sense required by both theorems. In this case, we show that the connection between feasible and proper systems can be further strengthened (since the equivalency between feasible and proper systems does not always hold) by including standard information theoretic outer bounds in the feasibility analysis.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2050480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466114","Degrees of freedom (DoF);interference alignment;interference channel;MIMO;mixed volume;Newton polytopes","MIMO;Transmitters;Polynomials;Signal processing;Interference channels;Equations;Geometry;Array signal processing;Information analysis","","588","5","31","IEEE","18 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use a path-based channel model, where the channel is described by a limited number of paths, each characterized by a delay, Doppler scale, and attenuation factor, and derive the exact inter-carrier-interference (ICI) pattern. For channels that have limited Doppler spread we show that subspace algorithms from the array processing literature, namely Root-MUSIC and ESPRIT, can be applied for channel estimation. For channels with Doppler spread, we adopt a compressed sensing approach, in form of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Basis Pursuit (BP) algorithms, and utilize overcomplete dictionaries with an increased path delay resolution. Numerical simulation and experimental data of an OFDM block-by-block receiver are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms in comparison to the conventional least-squares (LS) channel estimator. We observe that subspace methods can tolerate small to moderate Doppler effects, and outperform the LS approach when the channel is indeed sparse. On the other hand, compressed sensing algorithms uniformly outperform the LS and subspace methods. Coupled with a channel equalizer mitigating ICI, the compressed sensing algorithms can effectively handle channels with significant Doppler spread.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2038424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352256","Basis pursuit;Doppler spread;ESPRIT;ICI;MUSIC;OFDM;orthogonal matching pursuit","Channel estimation;Underwater acoustics;Underwater communication;Compressed sensing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Delay;Attenuation;Array signal processing;Pursuit algorithms;Dictionaries","","579","8","45","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The codebook model describes an image as a bag of discrete visual words selected from a vocabulary, where the frequency distributions of visual words in an image allow classification. One inherent component of the codebook model is the assignment of discrete visual words to continuous image features. Despite the clear mismatch of this hard assignment with the nature of continuous features, the approach has been successfully applied for some years. In this paper, we investigate four types of soft assignment of visual words to image features. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling visual word assignment ambiguity improves classification performance compared to the hard assignment of the traditional codebook model. The traditional codebook model is compared against our method for five well-known data sets: 15 natural scenes, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and Pascal VOC 2007/2008. We demonstrate that large codebook vocabulary sizes completely deteriorate the performance of the traditional model, whereas the proposed model performs consistently. Moreover, we show that our method profits in high-dimensional feature spaces and reaps higher benefits when increasing the number of image categories.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128909","Computer vision;object recognition;image/video retrieval.","Vocabulary;Image classification;Layout;Surface texture;Senior members;Frequency;Object recognition;Image retrieval;Surface cracks;Prototypes","","577","3","44","IEEE","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A supplementary loop is proposed around a conventional droop control of each DG converter to stabilize the system while using high angle droop gains. Control loops are based on local power measurement and modulation of the d-axis voltage reference of each converter. Coordinated design of supplementary control loops for each DG is formulated as a parameter optimization problem and solved using an evolutionary technique.

This paper considers the benefit of coordinating base-stations across multiple cells in a multi-antenna beamforming system, where multiple base-stations may jointly optimize their respective beamformers to improve the overall system performance. Consider a multicell downlink scenario where base-stations are equipped with multiple transmit antennas employing either linear beamforming or nonlinear dirty-paper coding, and where remote users are equipped with a single antenna each, but where multiple remote users may be active simultaneously in each cell. This paper focuses on the design criteria of minimizing either the total weighted transmitted power or the maximum per-antenna power across the base-stations subject to signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints at the remote users. The main contribution of the paper is an efficient algorithm for finding the joint globally optimal beamformers across all base-stations. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of uplink-downlink duality to the multicell setting using the Lagrangian duality theory. An important feature is that it naturally leads to a distributed implementation in time-division duplex (TDD) systems. Simulation results suggest that coordinating the beamforming vectors alone already provide appreciable performance improvements as compared to the conventional per-cell optimized network.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2010.05.090936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463229","Beamforming, dirty-paper coding, uplink-downlind duality;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multicell system","Array signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Wireless cellular systems;Signal processing;Interference;Background noise;System performance;Downlink;Signal design;Signal to noise ratio","","565","11","40","IEEE","13 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the map-reduce programming model is very low level and requires developers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. In this paper, we present Hive, an open-source data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop. Hive supports queries expressed in a SQL-like declarative language - HiveQL, which are compiled into map-reduce jobs that are executed using Hadoop. In addition, HiveQL enables users to plug in custom map-reduce scripts into queries. The language includes a type system with support for tables containing primitive types, collections like arrays and maps, and nested compositions of the same. The underlying IO libraries can be extended to query data in custom formats. Hive also includes a system catalog - Metastore - that contains schemas and statistics, which are useful in data exploration, query optimization and query compilation.

Since video signals are being delivered to human end users in an increasingly wide array of applications and products, it is important that automatic methods of video quality assessment (VQA) be available that can assist in controlling the quality of video being delivered to this critical audience. Naturally, the quality of motion representation in videos plays an important role in the perception of video quality, yet existing VQA algorithms make little direct use of motion information, thus limiting their effectiveness. We seek to ameliorate this by developing a general, spatio-spectrally localized multiscale framework for evaluating dynamic video fidelity that integrates both spatial and temporal (and spatio-temporal) aspects of distortion assessment. Video quality is evaluated not only in space and time, but also in space-time, by evaluating motion quality along computed motion trajectories. Using this framework, we develop a full reference VQA algorithm for which we coin the term the MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation index, or MOVIE index. It is found that the MOVIE index delivers VQA scores that correlate quite closely with human subjective judgment, using the Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG) FRTV Phase 1 database as a test bed. Indeed, the MOVIE index is found to be quite competitive with, and even outperform, algorithms developed and submitted to the VQEG FRTV Phase 1 study, as well as more recent VQA algorithms tested on this database.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2009.2034992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290142","Motion perception;perceptual quality;quality assessment;temporal distortion;video quality;visual perception","Quality assessment;Videos;Humans;Motion pictures;Indexes;Visual databases;Testing;Quality of service;Automatic control;Limiting","Algorithms;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Movement;Video Recording;Visual Perception","558","7","85","IEEE","20 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first show why the Fisher representation is well-suited to the retrieval problem: it describes an image by what makes it different from other images. One drawback of the Fisher vector is that it is high-dimensional and, as opposed to the BOV, it is dense. The resulting memory and computational costs do not make Fisher vectors directly amenable to large-scale retrieval. Therefore, we compress Fisher vectors to reduce their memory footprint and speed-up the retrieval. We compare three binarization approaches: a simple approach devised for this representation and two standard compression techniques. We show on two publicly available datasets that compressed Fisher vectors perform very well using as little as a few hundreds of bits per image, and significantly better than a very recent compressed BOV approach.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540009","","Large-scale systems;Image retrieval;Image coding;Vocabulary;Histograms;Quantization;Helium;Image storage;Random access memory;Europe","","548","24","27","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads.

In such infrastructures, composed of large numbers of networked, resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on-demand provisioning of missing functionality is a significant challenge.

The emerging field of compressed sensing combines nonlinear reconstruction algorithms and pseudorandom linear measurements to provide reconstruction guarantees for sparse solutions to linear inverse problems. This paper surveys the use of sparse reconstruction algorithms and randomized measurement strategies in radar processing. Although the two themes have a long history in radar literature, the accessible framework provided by compressed sensing illuminates the impact of joining these themes.

Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94% when only over- and undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.

Because of their high selectivity, their performance is very dependent on the accuracy of the resonant frequency. An exhaustive study about different discrete-time implementations is contributed in this paper. Some methods, such as the popular ones based on two integrators, cause that the resonant peaks differ from expected. Such inaccuracies result in significant loss of performance, especially for tracking high-frequency signals, since infinite gain at the expected frequency is not achieved, and therefore, zero steady-state error is not assured. Other discretization techniques are demonstrated to be more reliable. The effect on zeros is also analyzed, establishing the influence of each method on the stability. Finally, the study is extended to the discretization of the schemes with delay compensation, which is also proved to be of great importance in relation with their performance. A single-phase active power filter laboratory prototype has been implemented and tested. Experimental results provide a real-time comparison among discretization strategies, which validate the theoretical analysis.

In this paper, a novel emotion evocation and EEG-based feature extraction technique is presented. In particular, the mirror neuron system concept was adapted to efficiently foster emotion induction by the process of imitation. In addition, higher order crossings (HOC) analysis was employed for the feature extraction scheme and a robust classification method, namely HOC-emotion classifier (HOC-EC), was implemented testing four different classifiers [quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor, Mahalanobis distance, and support vector machines (SVMs)], in order to accomplish efficient emotion recognition. Through a series of facial expression image projection, EEG data have been collected by 16 healthy subjects using only 3 EEG channels, namely Fp1, Fp2, and a bipolar channel of F3 and F4 positions according to 10-20 system. Two scenarios were examined using EEG data from a single-channel and from combined-channels, respectively. Compared with other feature extraction methods, HOC-EC appears to outperform them, achieving a 62.3% (using QDA) and 83.33% (using SVM) classification accuracy for the single-channel and combined-channel cases, respectively, differentiating among the six basic emotions, i.e., happiness , surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. As the emotion class-set reduces its dimension, the HOC-EC converges toward maximum classification rate (100% for five or less emotions), justifying the efficiency of the proposed approach. This could facilitate the integration of HOC-EC in human machine interfaces, such as pervasive healthcare systems, enhancing their affective character and providing information about the user's emotional status (e.g., identifying user's emotion experiences, recurring affective states, time-dependent emotional trends).","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2034649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291724","Electroencephalogram (EEG);emotion recognition;higher order crossings analysis;$k$-nearest neighbor ( $k$-NN);Mahalanobis distance (MD);mirror neuron system;quadratic discriminant analysis;support vector machines (SVMs)","Emotion recognition;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Mirrors;Neurons;Robustness;Testing;Humans","Adult;Algorithms;Discriminant Analysis;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Facial Expression;Female;Humans;Imitative Behavior;Male;Models, Neurological;Recognition (Psychology);Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","526","1","43","IEEE","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to optimizing execution time, the cost arising from data transfers between resources as well as execution costs must also be taken into account. In this paper, we present a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based heuristic to schedule applications to cloud resources that takes into account both computation cost and data transmission cost. We experiment with a workflow application by varying its computation and communication costs. We compare the cost savings when using PSO and existing `Best Resource Selection' (BRS) algorithm.

Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) transmission is a promising technology for location-aware sensor networks, due to its power efficiency, fine delay resolution, and robust operation in harsh environments. However, the presence of walls and other obstacles presents a significant challenge in terms of localization, as they can result in positively biased distance estimates. We have performed an extensive indoor measurement campaign with FCC-compliant UWB radios to quantify the effect of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. From these channel pulse responses, we extract features that are representative of the propagation conditions. We then develop classification and regression algorithms based on machine learning techniques, which are capable of: (i) assessing whether a signal was transmitted in LOS or NLOS conditions; and (ii) reducing ranging error caused by NLOS conditions. We evaluate the resulting performance through Monte Carlo simulations and compare with existing techniques. In contrast to common probabilistic approaches that require statistical models of the features, the proposed optimization-based approach is more robust against modeling errors.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2010.100907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5555901","Localization;UWB;NLOS Identification;NLOS Mitigation;Support Vector Machine","Distance measurement;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Training;Delay;Laboratories;Optimization","","517","4","43","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a nonparametric and hyperparameter, free-weighted, least squares-based iterative adaptive approach for amplitude and phase estimation (IAA-APES) in array processing. IAA-APES can work well with few snapshots (even one), uncorrelated, partially correlated, and coherent sources, and arbitrary array geometries. IAA-APES is extended to give sparse results via a model-order selection tool, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Moreover, it is shown that further improvements in resolution and accuracy can be achieved by applying the parametric relaxation-based cyclic approach (RELAX) to refine the IAA-APES&BIC estimates if desired. IAA-APES can also be applied to active sensing applications, including single-input single-output (SISO) radar/sonar range-Doppler imaging and multi-input single-output (MISO) channel estimation for communications. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of IAA-APES for all of these applications, and IAA-APES is shown to outperform a number of existing approaches.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2010.5417172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5417172","","Iterative methods;Least squares methods;Array signal processing;Parameter estimation;Phase estimation;Geometry;Bayesian methods;Radar applications;Radar imaging;Sonar","","515","2","76","IEEE","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By using probability limit theory and algebraic graph theory, consensus conditions for this kind of protocols are obtained: (A) For the case of fixed topologies, a necessary and sufficient condition for mean square average-consensus is given, which is also sufficient for almost sure consensus. (B) For the case of time-varying topologies, sufficient conditions for mean square average-consensus and almost sure consensus are given, respectively. Especially, if the network switches between jointly-containing-spanning-tree, instantaneously balanced graphs, then the designed protocol can guarantee that each individual state converges, both almost surely and in mean square, to a common random variable, whose expectation is right the average of the initial states of the whole system, and whose variance describes the static maximum mean square error between each individual state and the average of the initial states of the whole system.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2010.2042982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411807","Average-consensus;distributed coordination;distributed estimation;multi-agent systems;stochastic systems","Multiagent systems;Time varying systems;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance;Network topology;Protocols;Working environment noise;Sufficient conditions;Communication system control;Graph theory","","513","1","43","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A collective of 33 subjects underwent a laboratory intervention that included mild cognitive load and two stress factors, which are relevant at the workplace: mental stress induced by solving arithmetic problems under time pressure and psychosocial stress induced by social-evaluative threat. During the experiments, a wearable device was used to monitor the EDA as a measure of the individual stress reaction. Analysis of the data showed that the distributions of the EDA peak height and the instantaneous peak rate carry information about the stress level of a person. Six classifiers were investigated regarding their ability to discriminate cognitive load from stress. A maximum accuracy of 82.8% was achieved for discriminating stress from cognitive load.

This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering. It describes a number of related positioning applications where geographical information systems provide a nonlinear measurement and where it should be obvious that classical approaches based on Kalman filters (KFs) would have poor performance. All applications are based on real data and several of them come from real-time implementations.

Instead of searching for the set of centroid that best fit the data, as in k-means type of approaches that model the data as distributions around discrete points, we optimize for a set of dictionaries, one for each cluster, for which the signals are best reconstructed in a sparse coding manner. Thereby, we are modeling the data as a union of learned low dimensional subspaces, and data points associated to subspaces spanned by just a few atoms of the same learned dictionary are clustered together. An incoherence promoting term encourages dictionaries associated to different classes to be as independent as possible, while still allowing for different classes to share features. This term directly acts on the dictionaries, thereby being applicable both in the supervised and unsupervised settings. Using learned dictionaries for classification and clustering makes this method robust and well suited to handle large datasets. The proposed framework uses a novel measurement for the quality of the sparse representation, inspired by the robustness of the ℓ1 regularization term in sparse coding. In the case of unsupervised classification and/or clustering, a new initialization based on combining sparse coding with spectral clustering is proposed. This initialization clusters the dictionary atoms, and therefore is based on solving a low dimensional eigen-decomposition problem, being applicable to large datasets. We first illustrate the proposed framework with examples on standard image and speech datasets in the supervised classification setting, obtaining results comparable to the state-of-the-art with this simple approach. We then present experiments for fully unsupervised clustering on extended standard datasets and texture images, obtaining excellent performance.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539964","","Dictionaries;Atomic measurements;Robustness;Clustering algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Image reconstruction;Speech;Linear approximation;Art;Image restoration","","505","11","34","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There, transformerless topologies, like the H5 and Heric, can reach very high levels of efficiency and allow the best cost-benefit ratio for low-power grid-tied systems. This paper will follow this direction and propose a single-phase transformerless inverter circuit being composed of the association of two step-down converters. Each one modulates a half-wave of the output current, as the correct polarity of the connection to the grid is provided by low-frequency switches. Due to its straightforward design, reduced amount of semiconductors, and simple operation, it is possible to achieve a high level of efficiency and reliability.

The `time-shifted' nature of these personalized applications defies the broadcast paradigm underlying conventional TV networks, and increases the overall bandwidth demands by orders of magnitude. Caching strategies provide an effective mechanism for mitigating these massive bandwidth requirements by replicating the most popular content closer to the network edge, rather than storing it in a central site. The reduction in the traffic load lessens the required transport capacity and capital expense, and alleviates performance bottlenecks. In the present paper, we develop light-weight cooperative cache management algorithms aimed at maximizing the traffic volume served from cache and minimizing the bandwidth cost. As a canonical scenario, we focus on a cluster of distributed caches, either connected directly or via a parent node, and formulate the content placement problem as a linear program in order to benchmark the globally optimal performance. Under certain symmetry assumptions, the optimal solution of the linear program is shown to have a rather simple structure. Besides interesting in its own right, the optimal structure offers valuable guidance for the design of low-complexity cache management and replacement algorithms. We establish that the performance of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed to be within a constant factor from the globally optimal performance, with far more benign worst-case ratios than in prior work, even in asymmetric scenarios. Numerical experiments for typical popularity distributions reveal that the actual performance is far better than the worst-case conditions indicate.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5461964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461964","","Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Libraries;IPTV;Multimedia communication;TV broadcasting;Cooperative caching;Clustering algorithms;Costs;Algorithm design and analysis","","499","41","20","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coherent processing requires a common phase reference for all transmit and receive sensors. The CRLB is shown to be inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth in the noncoherent case, but is approximately inversely proportional to the carrier frequency in the coherent case. We further prove that optimization over the sensors' positions lowers the CRLB by a factor equal to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors. The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) is derived for the MIMO target localization problem. The BLUE's utility is in providing a closed-form localization estimate that facilitates the analysis of the relations between sensors locations, target location, and localization accuracy.

One approach to deal with wind intermittency is forecasting future values of wind power production. Thus, several wind power or wind speed forecasting methods have been reported in the literature over the past few years. This paper provides insight on the foremost forecasting techniques, associated with wind power and speed, based on numeric weather prediction (NWP), statistical approaches, artificial neural network (ANN) and hybrid techniques over different time-scales. An overview of comparative analysis of various available forecasting techniques is discussed as well.

We demonstrate that all detectors can be derived within the same general likelihood ratio test (LRT) framework, given the different prior knowledge about the sensor signals. Further, by combining all prior knowledge, we derive a new LRT detector. Subsequently, we develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of the detectors.

This way, as it was demonstrated in recent experiments, the state of memristors does not essentially change during analog mode operation. As an example of our approach, we have built several programmable analog circuits demonstrating memristor-based programming of threshold, gain and frequency.

We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essential to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2047592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445011","Balance;feedback control;legged locomotion","Humans;Legged locomotion;Muscles;Shape control;Circuits;Control systems;Animals;Leg;Kinematics;Predictive models","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Feedback, Physiological;Gait;Humans;Joints;Leg;Models, Neurological;Muscle, Skeletal;Reflex;Walking","495","40","69","IEEE","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This hierarchical approach generates high quality segmentations, which are temporally coherent with stable region boundaries, and allows subsequent applications to choose from varying levels of granularity. We further improve segmentation quality by using dense optical flow to guide temporal connections in the initial graph. We also propose two novel approaches to improve the scalability of our technique: (a) a parallel out-of-core algorithm that can process volumes much larger than an in-core algorithm, and (b) a clip-based processing algorithm that divides the video into overlapping clips in time, and segments them successively while enforcing consistency. We demonstrate hierarchical segmentations on video shots as long as 40 seconds, and even support a streaming mode for arbitrarily long videos, albeit without the ability to process them hierarchically.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539893","","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Video sequences;Iterative algorithms;Tree graphs;Image motion analysis;Scalability;Streaming media","","494","22","23","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work presents a lightweight method for DDoS attack detection based on traffic flow features, in which the extraction of such information is made with a very low overhead compared to traditional approaches.

A key issue in the validation of soil moisture products is the disparity in spatial scales between satellite and in situ observations. Conventional measurements of soil moisture are made at a point, whereas satellite sensors provide an integrated area/volume value for a much larger spatial extent. In this paper, four soil moisture networks were developed and used as part of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) validation program. Each network is located in a different climatic region of the U.S., and provides estimates of the average soil moisture over highly instrumented experimental watersheds and surrounding areas that approximate the size of the AMSR-E footprint. Soil moisture measurements have been made at these validation sites on a continuous basis since 2002, which provided a seven-year period of record for this analysis. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) standard soil moisture products were compared to the network observations, along with two alternative soil moisture products developed using the single-channel algorithm (SCA) and the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). The metric used for validation is the root-mean-square error (rmse) of the soil moisture estimate as compared to the in situ data. The mission requirement for accuracy defined by the space agencies is 0.06 m3/m3. The statistical results indicate that each algorithm performs differently at each site. Neither the NASA nor the JAXA standard products provide reliable estimates for all the conditions represented by the four watershed sites. The JAXA algorithm performs better than the NASA algorithm under light-vegetation conditions, but the NASA algorithm is more reliable for moderate vegetation. However, both algorithms have a moderate to large bias in all cases. The SCA had the lowest overall rmse with a small bias. The LPRM had a very large overestimation bias and retrieval errors. When site-specific corrections were applied, all algorithms had approximately the same error level and correlation. These results clearly show that there is much room for improvement in the algorithms currently in use by JAXA and NASA. They also illustrate the potential pitfalls in using the products without a careful evaluation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497136","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observing System (AMSR-E);passive microwave;soil moisture;validation","Microwave radiometry;Soil moisture;NASA;Satellite broadcasting;Moisture measurement;Soil measurements;Remote sensing;Area measurement;Volume measurement;Instruments","","485","","52","IEEE","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generalised spatial modulation (GSM) overcomes in a novel fashion the constraint in SM that the number of transmit antennas has to be a power of two. In GSM, a block of information bits is mapped to a constellation symbol and a spatial symbol. The spatial symbol is a combination of transmit antennas activated at each instance. The actual combination of active transmit antennas depends on the random incoming data stream. This is unlike SM where only a single transmit antenna is activated at each instance. GSM increases the overall spectral efficiency by base-two logarithm of the number of antenna combinations. This reduces the number of transmit antennas needed for the same spectral efficiency. The performance of GSM is analysed in this paper, and an upper bound on the bit-error-ratio (BER) performance is derived. In addition, an algorithm to optimise the antenna combination selection is proposed. Finally, the performance of GSM is validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results are compared with traditional SM. It is shown that for the same spectral efficiency GSM performs nearly the same as SM, but with a significant reduction in the number of transmit antennas.","1058-6393","978-1-4244-9721-8","10.1109/ACSSC.2010.5757786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5757786","Spatial modulation;generalised spatial modulation;MIMO","Transmitting antennas;GSM;Complexity theory;Modulation;Receiving antennas;Bit error rate","","484","4","11","IEEE","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unquantized (analog) and quantized (digital) channel state feedback schemes are analyzed and compared under various assumptions. Digital feedback is shown to be potentially superior when the feedback channel uses per channel state coefficient is larger than 1. Also, we show that by proper design of the digital feedback link, errors in the feedback have a minor effect even if simple uncoded modulation is used on the feedback channel. We discuss first the case of an unfaded additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) feedback channel with orthogonal access and then the case of fading MIMO multiple access (MIMO-MAC). We show that by exploiting the MIMO-MAC nature of the uplink channel, a much better scaling of the feedback channel resource with the number of base station (BS) antennas can be achieved. Finally, for the case of delayed feedback, we show that in the realistic case where the fading process has (normalized) maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 ¿ F < 1/2, a fraction 1 - 2F of the optimal multiplexing gain is achievable.

Several ratios of LCL resonance frequency and control frequency are considered. At high resonance frequencies, only current feedback stabilizes the system.

Although the particle swarm optimization (PSO) approaches have several advantages suitable to heavily constrained nonconvex optimization problems, they still can have the drawbacks such as local optimal trapping due to premature convergence (i.e., exploration problem), insufficient capability to find nearby extreme points (i.e., exploitation problem), and lack of efficient mechanism to treat the constraints (i.e., constraint handling problem). This paper proposes an improved PSO framework employing chaotic sequences combined with the conventional linearly decreasing inertia weights and adopting a crossover operation scheme to increase both exploration and exploitation capability of the PSO. In addition, an effective constraint handling framework is employed for considering equality and inequality constraints. The proposed IPSO is applied to three different nonconvex ED problems with valve-point effects, prohibited operating zones with ramp rate limits as well as transmission network losses, and multi-fuels with valve-point effects.

We then evaluate and characterize the Hadoop framework using HiBench, in terms of speed (i.e., job running time), throughput (i.e., the number of tasks completed per minute), HDFS bandwidth, system resource (e.g., CPU, memory and I/O) utilizations, and data access patterns.","","978-1-4244-6523-1","10.1109/ICDEW.2010.5452747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452747","","Data analysis;Large-scale systems;Throughput;Bandwidth;Resource management;Open source software;Cloud computing;Personal communication networks;Explosives;Fault tolerance","","478","3","33","IEEE","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of them are so hard that we can, at best, approximate the best solutions with (meta-) heuristic methods. However, the huge number of optimization problems and the small number of generally acknowledged methods mean that more metaheuristics are needed to fill the gap. We propose a new metaheuristic, called chemical reaction optimization (CRO), to solve optimization problems. It mimics the interactions of molecules in a chemical reaction to reach a low energy stable state. We tested the performance of CRO with three nondeterministic polynomial-time hard combinatorial optimization problems. Two of them were traditional benchmark problems and the other was a real-world problem. Simulation results showed that CRO is very competitive with the few existing successful metaheuristics, having outperformed them in some cases, and CRO achieved the best performance in the real-world problem. Moreover, with the No-Free-Lunch theorem, CRO must have equal performance as the others on average, but it can outperform all other metaheuristics when matched to the right problem type. Therefore, it provides a new approach for solving optimization problems. CRO may potentially solve those problems which may not be solvable with the few generally acknowledged approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2033580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353674","Chemical reaction;metaheuristics;nature-inspired algorithms;optimization methods","Chemicals;Optimization methods;NP-hard problem;Cost function;Benchmark testing;Power generation economics;Interference;Electrical engineering;Buildings;Cities and towns","","473","","45","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These features result in a much simpler adaptive control algorithm, which is convenient to implement in applications.

The discrete-time complex networks under consideration are subject to: (1) stochastic nonlinearities that occur according to the Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences; (2) stochastic disturbances that enter the coupling term, the delayed coupling term as well as the overall network; and (3) time delays that include both the discrete and distributed ones. Note that the newly introduced RONs and the multiple stochastic disturbances can better reflect the dynamical behaviors of coupled complex networks whose information transmission process is affected by a noisy environment (e.g., Internet-based control systems). By constructing a novel Lyapunov-like matrix functional, the idea of delay fractioning is applied to deal with the addressed synchronization analysis problem. By employing a combination of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, the free-weighting matrix method and stochastic analysis theories, several delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained which ensure the asymptotic synchronization in the mean square sense for the discrete-time stochastic complex networks with time delays. The criteria derived are characterized in terms of LMIs whose solution can be solved by utilizing the standard numerical software.

Compared to alternative battery technologies, Li-ion batteries provide one of the best energy-to-weight ratios, exhibit no memory effect, and have low self-discharge when not in use. These beneficial properties, as well as decreasing costs, have established Li-ion batteries as a leading candidate for the next generation of automotive and aerospace applications. In the automotive sector, increasing demand for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs (PHEVs), and EVs has pushed manufacturers to the limits of contemporary automotive battery technology. This limitation is gradually forcing consideration of alternative battery technologies, such as Li-ion batteries, as a replacement for existing leadacid and nickel-metal-hydride batteries. Unfortunately, this replacement is a challenging task since automotive applications demand large amounts of energy and power and must operate safely, reliably, and durably at these scales.

We obtain an analytical closed-form expression of an achievable secrecy rate and use it as the objective function to optimize the transmit power allocation between the information signal and the artificial noise. Our analytical and numerical results show that equal power allocation is a simple yet near-optimal strategy for the case of noncolluding eavesdroppers. When the number of colluding eavesdroppers increases, more power should be used to generate the artificial noise. We also provide an upper bound on the SNR, above which, the achievable secrecy rate is positive and shows that the bound is tight at low SNR. Furthermore, we consider the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver and find that it is wise to create more artificial noise to confuse the eavesdroppers than to increase the signal strength for the intended receiver if the CSI is not accurately obtained.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2010.2059057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524086","Artificial noise;channel estimation error;multiantenna transmission;power allocation;secrecy rate","Fading;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitters;Information analysis;Signal analysis;Closed-form solution;Power generation;Noise generators;Upper bound;Channel state information","","462","2","32","IEEE","26 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been applied in various areas, such as imaging, radar, speech recognition, and data acquisition. In communications, compressive sensing is largely accepted for sparse channel estimation and its variants. In this article we highlight the fundamental concepts of compressive sensing and give an overview of its application to pilot aided channel estimation. We point out that a popular assumption - that multipath channels are sparse in their equivalent baseband representation - has pitfalls. There are over-complete dictionaries that lead to much sparser channel representations and better estimation performance. As a concrete example, we detail the application of compressive sensing to multicarrier underwater acoustic communications, where the channel features sparse arrivals, each characterized by its distinct delay and Doppler scale factor. To work with practical systems, several modifications need to be made to the compressive sensing framework as the channel estimation error varies with how detailed the channel is modeled, and how data and pilot symbols are mixed in the signal design.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5621984","","Compressed sensing;Channel estimation;Approximation methods;Baseband;Frequency response;Discrete Fourier transforms;Delay","","458","3","16","IEEE","4 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The goal of the base stations is to jointly adjust the beamforming vectors to minimize the transmission powers while ensuring the signal-to-interference-noise ratio requirement of each user within the system. At the same time, it may be necessary to keep the interference generated on other coexisting systems under a certain tolerable level. In addition, one may want to include general individual shaping constraints on the beamforming vectors. This beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic program, and it is difficult to solve in general. In this paper, we give conditions under which strong duality holds and propose efficient algorithms for the optimal beamforming problem. First, we study rank-constrained solutions of general separable semidefinite programs (SDPs) and propose rank reduction procedures to achieve a lower rank solution.

Each source STFT is given a model inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito divergence, which underlies a statistical model of superimposed Gaussian components. We address estimation of the mixing and source parameters using two methods. The first one consists of maximizing the exact joint likelihood of the multichannel data using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The second method consists of maximizing the sum of individual likelihoods of all channels using a multiplicative update algorithm inspired from NMF methodology. Our decomposition algorithms are applied to stereo audio source separation in various settings, covering blind and supervised separation, music and speech sources, synthetic instantaneous and convolutive mixtures, as well as professionally produced music recordings.

The assumption on the availability of UAV dynamics is not always practical, especially in an outdoor environment. Therefore, in this work, an NN is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV online, including uncertain nonlinear terms like aerodynamic friction and blade flapping. Although a quadrotor UAV is underactuated, a novel NN virtual control input scheme is proposed which allows all six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the UAV to be controlled using only four control inputs. Furthermore, an NN observer is introduced to estimate the translational and angular velocities of the UAV, and an output feedback control law is developed in which only the position and the attitude of the UAV are considered measurable. It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the position, orientation, and velocity tracking errors, the virtual control and observer estimation errors, and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are all semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors while simultaneously relaxing the separation principle. The effectiveness of proposed output feedback control scheme is then demonstrated in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and simulation results are included to demonstrate the theoretical conjecture.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2034145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345702","Lyapunov method;neural network (NN);observer;output feedback;quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Output feedback;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Neural networks;Aerodynamics;Vehicle dynamics;Error correction;Estimation error;Friction;Blades;Angular velocity","Algorithms;Biomechanics;Computer Simulation;Feedback;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Systems Theory","456","","24","IEEE","4 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signals are reconstructed as minimizers of the sum of three terms corresponding to total variation, $\ell_1$ -norm of a certain transform, and least squares data fitting. Our algorithm, called RecPF and published online, runs very fast (typically in a few seconds on a laptop) because it requires a small number of iterations, each involving simple shrinkages and two fast Fourier transforms (or alternatively discrete cosine transforms when measurements are in the corresponding domain). RecPF was compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms on recovering magnetic resonance images, and the results show that it is highly efficient, stable, and robust.

To be consistent with the literature, the resulting nonlinear filter is referred to as the continuous-discrete cubature Kalman filter (CD-CKF). We use the Itô-Taylor expansion of order 1.5 to transform the process equation, modeled in the form of stochastic ordinary differential equations, into a set of stochastic difference equations. Building on this transformation and assuming that all conditional densities are Gaussian-distributed, the solution to the Bayesian filter reduces to the problem of how to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals. To numerically compute the integrals, we use the third-degree cubature rule. For a reliable implementation of the CD-CKF in a finite word-length machine, it is structurally modified to propagate the square-roots of the covariance matrices. The reliability and accuracy of the square-root version of the CD-CKF are tested in a case study that involves the use of a radar problem of practical significance; the problem considered herein is challenging in the context of radar in two respects- high dimensionality of the state and increasing degree of nonlinearity.

In this article, a holistic approach for energy efficient mobile radio networks is presented. The matter of having appropriate metrics and evaluation methods that allow assessing the energy efficiency of the entire system is discussed. The mutual supplementary saving concepts comprise component, link and network levels. At the component level the power amplifier complemented by a transceiver and a digital platform supporting advanced power management are key to efficient radio implementations. Discontinuous transmission by base stations, where hardware components are switched off, facilitate energy efficient operation at the link level. At the network level, the potential for reducing energy consumption is in the layout of networks and their management, that take into account slowly changing daily load patterns, as well as highly dynamic traffic fluctuations. Moreover, research has to analyze new disruptive architectural approaches, including multi-hop transmission, ad-hoc meshed networks, terminal-to-terminal communications, and cooperative multipoint architectures.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5621969","","Energy efficiency;Base stations;Power demand;Power amplifiers;Mobile communication;Energy consumption;Measurement","","448","8","12","IEEE","4 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, if the whole power distribution system were designed as a system of controllable converters, the overall system cost and reliability could actually improve, as is currently the case at low power levels within computer and telecom equipment. Starting from the example of a computer power system, the paper contemplates possible future ac and dc electronic power distribution system architectures, especially in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed nanogrid-microgrid-…-grid structure achieves hierarchical dynamic decoupling of generation, distribution, and consumption by using bidirectional converters as energy control centers. This is illustrated by the description and simulation of static and dynamic operation of a dc nanogrid in a hypothetical future sustainable home.

Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5072212","Virtual reality;virtual locomotion;redirected walking.","Legged locomotion;Virtual environment;Cameras;Navigation;Large-scale systems;Displays;Tracking;Psychology;Humans;Testing","Adult;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Female;Gait;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Middle Aged;Models, Theoretical;Orientation;Psychomotor Performance;Sensory Thresholds;User-Computer Interface;Walking;Young Adult","446","8","40","IEEE","12 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data has to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords, these techniques support only boolean search, without capturing any relevance of data files. This approach suffers from two main drawbacks when directly applied in the context of Cloud Computing. On the one hand, users, who do not necessarily have pre-knowledge of the encrypted cloud data, have to post process every retrieved file in order to find ones most matching their interest, On the other hand, invariably retrieving all files containing the queried keyword further incurs unnecessary network traffic, which is absolutely undesirable in today's pay-as-you-use cloud paradigm. In this paper, for the first time we define and solve the problem of effective yet secure ranked keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files in a ranked order regarding to certain relevance criteria (e.g., keyword frequency), thus making one step closer towards practical deployment of privacy-preserving data hosting services in Cloud Computing. We first give a straightforward yet ideal construction of ranked keyword search under the state-of-the-art searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) security definition, and demonstrate its inefficiency. To achieve more practical performance, we then propose a definition for ranked searchable symmetric encryption, and give an efficient design by properly utilizing the existing cryptographic primitive, order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE). Thorough analysis shows that our proposed solution enjoys ``as-strong-as-possible"" security guarantee compared to previous SSE schemes, while correctly realizing the goal of ranked keyword search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution.","1063-6927","978-1-4244-7262-8","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541682","","Keyword search;Cryptography;Cloud computing;Information retrieval;Protection;Data privacy;Outsourcing;Telecommunication traffic;Usability;Frequency","","446","9","22","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate that learning to place the sigma points correctly from data can make sigma point collapse much less likely. Learning can result in a significant increase in predictive performance over default settings of the parameters in the UKF and other filters designed to avoid the problems of the UKF, such as the GP-ADF.

In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms to efficiently solve these optimization problems, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, a method from the augmented Lagrangian family. The algorithms are termed SUnSAL (sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian) and C-SUnSAL (constrained SUnSAL).

Remote-sensing satellites equipped with very high spatial resolution (VHR) multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensors can provide vital information due to their ability to map the affected areas with high geometric precision and in an uncensored manner. In this paper, we present a novel method that detects buildings destroyed in an earthquake using pre-event VHR optical and post-event detected VHR SAR imagery. The method operates at the level of individual buildings and assumes that they have a rectangular footprint and are isolated. First, the 3-D parameters of a building are estimated from the pre-event optical imagery. Second, the building information and the acquisition parameters of the VHR SAR scene are used to predict the expected signature of the building in the post-event SAR scene assuming that it is not affected by the event. Third, the similarity between the predicted image and the actual SAR image is analyzed. If the similarity is high, the building is likely to be still intact, whereas a low similarity indicates that the building is destroyed. A similarity threshold is used to classify the buildings. We demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the method for a subset of the town of Yingxiu, China, which was heavily damaged in the Sichuan earthquake of May 12, 2008.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial).

The resolution in the elevation direction depends on the size of the elevation aperture, i.e., on the spread of orbit tracks. Since the orbits of modern meter-resolution spaceborne SAR systems, like TerraSAR-X, are tightly controlled, the tomographic elevation resolution is at least an order of magnitude lower than in range and azimuth. Hence, super-resolution reconstruction algorithms are desired. The high anisotropy of the 3-D tomographic resolution element renders the signals sparse in the elevation direction; only a few pointlike reflections are expected per azimuth-range cell. This property suggests using compressive sensing (CS) methods for tomographic reconstruction. This paper presents the theory of 4-D (differential, i.e., space-time) CS TomoSAR and compares it with parametric (nonlinear least squares) and nonparametric (singular value decomposition) reconstruction methods. Super-resolution properties and point localization accuracies are demonstrated using simulations and real data. A CS reconstruction of a building complex from TerraSAR-X spotlight data is presented.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2048117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482209","Compressive sensing (CS);differential synthetic aperture radar tomography (D-TomoSAR);TerraSAR-X;urban mapping","Tomography;Signal resolution;Reconstruction algorithms;Image reconstruction;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar tracking;Spaceborne radar;Control systems;Azimuth;Anisotropic magnetoresistance","","430","4","28","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We evaluated the performance of our device against a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved system for the measurement of EDA during physical, cognitive, as well as emotional stressors at both palmar and distal forearm sites, and found high correlations across all the tests. We also evaluated the choice of electrode material by comparing conductive fabric with Ag/AgCl electrodes and discuss the limitations found. An important result presented in this paper is evidence that the distal forearm is a viable alternative to the traditional palmar sites for EDA measurements. Our device offers the unprecedented ability to perform comfortable, long-term, and in situ assessment of EDA.

The end-to-end (including the channel) models developed for classical wireless communication networks need to undergo a profound revision so that they can be applied for nanonetworks. Consequently, there is a need to develop new end-to-end (including the channel) models which can give new insights into the design of these nanoscale networks. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new physical end-to-end (including the channel) model for molecular communication. The new model is investigated by means of three modules, i.e., the transmitter, the signal propagation and the receiver. Each module is related to a specific process involving particle exchanges, namely, particle emission, particle diffusion and particle reception. The particle emission process involves the increase or decrease of the particle concentration rate in the environment according to a modulating input signal. The particle diffusion provides the propagation of particles from the transmitter to the receiver by means of the physics laws underlying particle diffusion in the space. The particle reception process is identified by the sensing of the particle concentration value at the receiver location. Numerical results are provided for three modules, as well as for the overall end-to-end model, in terms of normalized gain and delay as functions of the input frequency and of the transmission range.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2010.100509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452953","Nanotechnology, Nanonetworks, Molecular Communication, Physical End-to-End Modeling, Physical Channel Modeling, Particle Diffusion","Molecular communication;Transmitters;Nanoscale devices;Computer architecture;Transceivers;Wireless communication;Signal processing;Physics;Delay;Frequency","","423","","20","IEEE","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the two time slot PNC scheme offers a higher maximum sum-rate, but a lower sum-bit error rate (BER) than the four time slot transmission scheme for a number of practical scenarios. We also show that the three time slot PNC scheme offers a good compromise between the two and four time slot transmission schemes, and also achieves the best maximum sum-rate and/or sum-BER in certain practical scenarios. To facilitate comparison, we derive new closed-form expressions for the outage probability, maximum sum-rate and sum-BER. We also consider an opportunistic relaying scheme for a network with multiple relay nodes, where a single relay is chosen to maximize either the maximum sum-rate or minimize the sum-BER.

The weighted average value of the currents flowing through the two inductors of the LCL filter is used as the feedback to the current PR regulator. Consequently, the control system with the LCL filter is degraded from a third-order function to a first-order one. A large proportional control-loop gain can be chosen to obtain a wide control-loop bandwidth, and the system can be optimized easily for minimum current harmonic distortions, as well as system stability.

WBAN has shown great potential in improving healthcare quality, and thus has found a wide range of applications from ubiquitous health monitoring and computer assisted rehabilitation to emergency medical response systems. The security and privacy protection of the data collected from a WBAN, either while stored inside the WBAN or during their transmission outside of the WBAN, is a major unsolved concern, with challenges coming from stringent resource constraints of WBAN devices, and the high demand for both security/privacy and practicality/usability. In this article we look into two important data security issues: secure and dependable distributed data storage, and fine-grained distributed data access control for sensitive and private patient medical data. We discuss various practical issues that need to be taken into account while fulfilling the security and privacy requirements. Relevant solutions in sensor networks and WBANs are surveyed, and their applicability is analyzed.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2010.5416350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416350","","Data security;Data privacy;Body sensor networks;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Wearable sensors;Wireless communication;Medical services;Application software;Patient monitoring","","418","6","15","IEEE","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To address these issues, an ESO is designed, which estimates the state vector, as well as the uncertainties in an integrated manner. The FL controller uses the states estimated by ESO, and the effect of uncertainties is compensated by augmenting the FL controller with the ESO-estimated uncertainties. The closed-loop stability of the system under the proposed observer-controller structure is established. The effectiveness of the ESO in the estimation of the states and uncertainties and the effectiveness of the FL + ESO controller in tracking are demonstrated through simulations.

Although such frequent metering data may be required by a utility or electrical energy distribution network for operational reasons, this data may not necessarily need to be attributable to a specific smart meter or consumer. It does, however, need to be securely attributable to a specific location (e.g. a group of houses or apartments) within the electricity distribution network.

Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources.

The upper level recognition uses the autoregressive (AR) modeling of the acceleration signals, thus, incorporating the derived AR-coefficients along with the signal-magnitude area and tilt angle to form an augmented-feature vector. The resulting feature vector is further processed by the linear-discriminant analysis and ANNs to recognize a particular human activity.

We have shown previously that GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data can be used to generate a high-resolution infrared remittance ground map that can be subsequently used for localization. We now propose an extension to this approach that yields substantial improvements over previous work in vehicle localization, including higher precision, the ability to learn and improve maps over time, and increased robustness to environment changes and dynamic obstacles. Specifically, we model the environment, instead of as a spatial grid of fixed infrared remittance values, as a probabilistic grid whereby every cell is represented as its own gaussian distribution over remittance values. Subsequently, Bayesian inference is able to preferentially weight parts of the map most likely to be stationary and of consistent angular reflectivity, thereby reducing uncertainty and catastrophic errors. Furthermore, by using offline SLAM to align multiple passes of the same environment, possibly separated in time by days or even months, it is possible to build an increasingly robust understanding of the world that can be then exploited for localization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using these algorithms to localize our vehicle against probabilistic maps in various dynamic environments, achieving RMS accuracy in the 10cm-range and thus outperforming previous work. Importantly, this approach has enabled us to autonomously drive our vehicle for hundreds of miles in dense traffic on narrow urban roads which were formerly unnavigable with previous localization methods.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509700","","Robustness;Remotely operated vehicles;Vehicle dynamics;Mobile robots;Navigation;Global Positioning System;Laser radar;Gaussian distribution;Bayesian methods;Reflectivity","","405","74","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, we find that in most existing approaches, the choice of embedding positions within a cover image mainly depends on a pseudorandom number generator without considering the relationship between the image content itself and the size of the secret message. Thus the smooth/flat regions in the cover images will inevitably be contaminated after data hiding even at a low embedding rate, and this will lead to poor visual quality and low security based on our analysis and extensive experiments, especially for those images with many smooth regions. In this paper, we expand the LSB matching revisited image steganography and propose an edge adaptive scheme which can select the embedding regions according to the size of secret message and the difference between two consecutive pixels in the cover image. For lower embedding rates, only sharper edge regions are used while keeping the other smoother regions as they are. When the embedding rate increases, more edge regions can be released adaptively for data hiding by adjusting just a few parameters. The experimental results evaluated on 6000 natural images with three specific and four universal steganalytic algorithms show that the new scheme can enhance the security significantly compared with typical LSB-based approaches as well as their edge adaptive ones, such as pixel-value-differencing-based approaches, while preserving higher visual quality of stego images at the same time.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2041812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411758","Content-based steganography;least-significant-bit (LSB)-based steganography;pixel-value differencing (PVD);security;steganalysis","Steganography;Data encapsulation;Data security;Pixel;Information security;Algorithm design and analysis;Image analysis;Atherosclerosis;Random media;Information science","","404","","30","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There exist supervised hashing methods that can handle such semantic similarity but they are prone to overfitting when labeled data is small or noisy. Moreover, these methods are usually very slow to train. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised hashing method that is formulated as minimizing empirical error on the labeled data while maximizing variance and independence of hash bits over the labeled and unlabeled data.

This paper develops algorithms to estimate the regression coefficients via Lasso when the training data are distributed across different agents, and their communication to a central processing unit is prohibited for e.g., communication cost or privacy reasons. A motivating application is explored in the context of wireless communications, whereby sensing cognitive radios collaborate to estimate the radio-frequency power spectrum density. Attaining different tradeoffs between complexity and convergence speed, three novel algorithms are obtained after reformulating the Lasso into a separable form, which is iteratively minimized using the alternating-direction method of multipliers so as to gain the desired degree of parallelization. Interestingly, the per agent estimate updates are given by simple soft-thresholding operations, and inter-agent communication overhead remains at affordable level. Without exchanging elements from the different training sets, the local estimates consent to the global Lasso solution, i.e., the fit that would be obtained if the entire data set were centrally available. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed distributed schemes, corroborating their convergence and global optimality. The ideas in this paper can be easily extended for the purpose of fitting related models in a distributed fashion, including the adaptive Lasso, elastic net, fused Lasso and nonnegative garrote.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2055862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499155","Distributed linear regression;Lasso;parallel optimization;sparse estimation","Linear regression;Input variables;Training data;Central Processing Unit;Costs;Data privacy;Context;Wireless communication;Cognitive radio;Collaboration","","401","2","40","IEEE","1 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed PV system employs a ZVT-interleaved boost converter with winding-coupled inductors and active-clamp circuits as the first power-processing stage, which can boost a low voltage of the PV array up to a high dc-bus voltage. Accordingly, an accurate steady-state model is obtained and verified by the simulation and experimental results, and a full-bridge inverter with bidirectional power flow is used as the second power-processing stage, which can stabilize the dc-bus voltage and shape the output current. Two compensation units are added to perform in the system control loops to achieve the low total harmonic distortion and fast dynamic response of the output current.

However, based on Ontario's standard offer program (SOP), the utility has the right to curtail (spill) wind energy in order to avoid any violation of the system constraints. This means that any increase in wind energy production over a specific limit might be met with an increase in the wind energy curtailed. In spite of their cost, energy storage systems (ESSs) are considered to be a viable solution to this problem. This paper proposes a methodology for allocating an ESS in a distribution system with a high penetration of wind energy. The ultimate goal is to maximize the benefits for both the DG owner and the utility by sizing the ESS to accommodate all amounts of spilled wind energy and by then allocating it within the system in order to minimize the annual cost of the electricity.

The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the United Nations--Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) along with the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore for their contributions to global warming. There is no doubt that energy has been the lifeblood in the evolution of our industrial civilization, and per capita energy consumption has been the barometer of a nation's prosperity. In the old days of the preindustrial revolution era, as indicated in Figure 1, mankind was mainly dependent on animal and manual labor. In this muscle age, our life style was very simple and unsophisticated, and the environment was clean. In 1785, James Watt of Scotland invented the steam engine that ushered in the Industrial Revolution, and we were brought into the mechanical age or age of machines. The Industrial Revolution gained momentum by the invention of internal combustion engine in the late 19th century. The wave of the Industrial Revolution gradually spread from Europe to the United States, and then to the rest of the world. The electrical revolution or electrical age started by the commercial availability of electricity in the mid-1880s, when at the same time, the commercial induction motor was invented (1888) by Nickola Tesla. The commercial dc motor was introduced at a slightly earlier date (1873), and then the synchronous motor arrived at a slightly later date (1891). The electronics revolution or the age of modern solid-state electronics was ushered in by the invention of the transistor in 1948 by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley of Bell Laboratories. Bell Laboratories also invented the thyristor (called the PNPN triggering transistor) in 1956, and then the thyristor (or silicon controlled rectifier) was commercially introduced by General Electric (GE) in 1958. This brought us to the modern age of solid-state power electronics. We often say that invention of the transistor brought in the first electronics revolution, whereas the invention of the thyristor brought in the second electronics revolution. Gradually, the eras of integrated circuits, computers, communication, and robotics arrived. We now live in an Internet age that shrank the world into a global village. Human society is now more interdependent than ever. During the mechanical, electrical, and electronics ages, the energy consumption in the world has grown by leaps and bounds to cater the need of growing world population and improvement of our standard of living. So far, we have hardly paid much attention to the adverse effect of energy consumption, i.e., environmental pollution.","1941-0115","","10.1109/MIE.2010.935860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439042","","Global warming;Pollution;Power electronics;Energy consumption;Fossil fuels;Environmental factors;Sea level;Hurricanes;Tornadoes;Floods;Climate change","","391","","39","IEEE","25 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Existing algorithms suffer from the “freezing robot” problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in “joint collision avoidance”: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-6676-4","10.1109/IROS.2010.5654369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654369","","Navigation;Trajectory;Collision avoidance;Robot kinematics;Joints;Predictive models","","391","2","27","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions, we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540235","","Context modeling;Humans","","389","2","32","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the no free lunch theorem, it is impossible for a single constraint handling technique to outperform all other techniques on every problem. In other words, depending on several factors such as the ratio between feasible search space and the whole search space, multimodality of the problem, the chosen EA, and global exploration/local exploitation stages of the search process, different constraint handling methods can be effective during different stages of the search process. Motivated by these observations, we propose an ensemble of constraint handling techniques (ECHT) to solve constrained real-parameter optimization problems, where each constraint handling method has its own population. A distinguishing feature of the ECHT is the usage of every function call by each population associated with each constraint handling technique. Being a general concept, the ECHT can be realized with any existing EA. In this paper, we present two instantiations of the ECHT using four constraint handling methods with the evolutionary programming and differential evolution as the EAs. Experimental results show that the performance of ECHT is better than each single constraint handling method used to form the ensemble with the respective EA, and competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2033582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395672","Constrained optimization;differential evolution;ensemble of constraint handling techniques;ensemble of optimization algorithms;evolutionary programming","Constraint optimization;Evolutionary computation;Constraint theory;Genetic programming;Search methods;Sorting;Particle swarm optimization","","387","","48","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this competition, we compare the results of five different methods, produced by five different teams of researchers on the same set of data.

Two novel concepts of sparsity at the patch level are proposed for modeling the patch priority and patch representation, which are two crucial steps for patch propagation in the examplar-based inpainting approach. First, patch structure sparsity is designed to measure the confidence of a patch located at the image structure (e.g., the edge or corner) by the sparseness of its nonzero similarities to the neighboring patches. The patch with larger structure sparsity will be assigned higher priority for further inpainting. Second, it is assumed that the patch to be filled can be represented by the sparse linear combination of candidate patches under the local patch consistency constraint in a framework of sparse representation. Compared with the traditional examplar-based inpainting approach, structure sparsity enables better discrimination of structure and texture, and the patch sparse representation forces the newly inpainted regions to be sharp and consistent with the surrounding textures. Experiments on synthetic and natural images show the advantages of the proposed approach.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2042098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5404308","Image inpainting;patch propagation;patch sparsity;sparse representation;texture synthesis","TV;Statistics;Sun;Computer vision;Image processing;Application software;Image restoration;Image coding;Pixel","Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","386","3","46","IEEE","2 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, D2D transmitters may cause significant amount of interference to the primary cellular network when radio resources are shared between them. During the downlink (DL) phase, primary cell UE (user equipment) may suffer from interference by the D2D transmitter. On the other hand, the immobile eNodeB is the victim of interference by the D2D transmitter during the uplink (UL) phase when radio resources are allocated randomly. Such interference can be avoided otherwise diminish if radio resource allocated intelligently with the coordination from the eNodeB. In this paper, we formulate the problem of radio resource allocation to the D2D communications as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Such an optimization problem is notoriously hard to solve within fast scheduling period of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. We therefore propose an alternative greedy heuristic algorithm that can lessen interference to the primary cellular network utilizing channel gain information. We also perform extensive simulation to prove the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","2160-4894","978-1-4244-7742-5","10.1109/WIMOB.2010.5645039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645039","","Interference;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Signal to noise ratio;Resource management;Radio transmitters;Gain","","386","25","22","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These new types of base-stations can operate on the same wireless channel as the macro-cellular network, providing higher spatial reuse via cell splitting. However, these base-stations are deployed in an unplanned manner, can have very different transmit powers, and may not have traffic aggregation among many users. This could potentially result in much higher interference magnitude and variability. Hence, such deployments require the use of innovative cell association and inter-cell interference coordination techniques in order to realize the promised capacity and coverage gains. In this paper, we describe new paradigms for design and operation of such heterogeneous cellular networks. Specifically, we focus on cell splitting, range expansion, semi-static resource negotiation on third-party backhaul connections, and fast dynamic interference management for QoS via over-the-air signaling. Notably, our methodologies and algorithms are simple, lightweight, and incur extremely low overhead.

It first models biological tissue as a dispersive dielectric in a homogeneous medium and performs full-wave analysis to show that the optimal frequency is above 1 GHz for small receive coil and typical transmit-receive separations. Then, it includes the air-tissue interface and models human body as a planarly layered medium. The optimal frequency is shown to remain in the GHz-range. Finally, electromagnetic simulations are performed to include the effect of load impedance and look at the matched power gain.

Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters.

At the SU, channel-state information (CSI) between its transmitter and the PU receiver is used to calculate the maximum allowable SU transmit power to limit the interference. We assume that this CSI is imperfect, which is an important scenario for CR systems. In addition to a peak received interference power constraint, an upper limit to the SU transmit power constraint is also considered. We derive a closed-form expression for the mean SU capacity under this scenario. Due to imperfect CSI, the SU cannot always satisfy the peak received interference power constraint at the PU and has to back off its transmit power. The resulting capacity loss for the SU is quantified using the cumulative-distribution function of the interference at the PU. Additionally, we investigate the impact of CSI quantization. To investigate the SU error performance, a closed-form average bit-error-rate (BER) expression was also derived.

It uses stacks of several acquisitions from slightly different viewing angles (the elevation aperture) to reconstruct the reflectivity function along the elevation direction by means of spectral analysis for every azimuth-range pixel. The new class of meter-resolution spaceborne SAR systems (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-Skymed) offers a tremendous improvement in tomographic reconstruction of urban areas and man-made infrastructure. The high resolution fits well to the inherent scale of buildings (floor height, distance of windows, etc.). This paper demonstrates the tomographic potential of these SARs and the achievable quality on the basis of TerraSAR-X spotlight data of urban environment. A new Wiener-type regularization to the singular-value decomposition method-equivalent to a maximum a posteriori estimator-for TomoSAR is introduced and is extended to the differential case (4-D, i.e., space-time). Different model selection schemes for the estimation of the number of scatterers in a resolution cell are compared and proven to be applicable in practice. Two parametric estimation algorithms of the scatterers' elevation and their velocities are evaluated.

Biogeography deals with the geographical distribution of biological species. Mathematical models of biogeography describe how a species arises, migrates from one habitat to another and gets wiped out. BBO has some features that are in common with other biology-based optimization methods, like genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This algorithm searches for the global optimum mainly through two steps: migration and mutation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified on four different test systems, both small and large, involving varying degree of complexity. Compared with the other existing techniques, the proposed algorithm has been found to perform better in a number of cases. Considering the quality of the solution obtained, this method seems to be a promising alternative approach for solving the ELD problems in practical power system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2034525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342456","Biogeography-based optimization;economic load dispatch;genetic algorithm;particle swarm optimization;prohibited operating zone","Power generation economics;Biogeography;Thermal loading;Propagation losses;Valves;Mathematical model;Optimization methods;Genetic algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Genetic mutations","","378","","17","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Joint estimation of the model parameters enables identification of the (un)used frequency bands at arbitrary locations, and thus facilitates spatial frequency reuse. The novel scheme capitalizes on two forms of sparsity: the first one introduced by the narrow-band nature of transmit-PSDs relative to the broad swaths of usable spectrum; and the second one emerging from sparsely located active radios in the operational space. An estimator of the model coefficients is developed based on the Lasso algorithm to exploit these forms of sparsity and reveal the unknown positions of transmitting CRs. The resultant scheme can be implemented via distributed online iterations, which solve quadratic programs locally (one per radio), and are adaptive to changes in the system. Simulations corroborate that exploiting sparsity in CR sensing reduces spatial and frequency spectrum leakage by 15 dB relative to least-squares (LS) alternatives.

In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling.

Recent surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks have relied on the use of a variety of different modeling approaches to approximate the complex problem landscape. From these recent studies, one main research issue is with the choice of modeling scheme used, which has been found to affect the performance of evolutionary search significantly. Given that theoretical knowledge available for making a decision on an approximation model a priori is very much limited, this paper describes a generalization of surrogate-assisted evolutionary frameworks for optimization of problems with objectives and constraints that are computationally expensive to evaluate. The generalized evolutionary framework unifies diverse surrogate models synergistically in the evolutionary search. In particular, it focuses on attaining reliable search performance in the surrogate-assisted evolutionary framework by working on two major issues: 1) to mitigate the 'curse of uncertainty' robustly, and 2) to benefit from the 'bless of uncertainty.' The backbone of the generalized framework is a surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm that conducts simultaneous local searches using ensemble and smoothing surrogate models, with the aims of generating reliable fitness prediction and search improvements simultaneously. Empirical study on commonly used optimization benchmark problems indicates that the generalized framework is capable of attaining reliable, high quality, and efficient performance under a limited computational budget.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2027359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5352247","Approximation models;computationally expensive problems;memetic algorithms;metamodels;surrogate models;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms","Evolutionary computation;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Constraint optimization;Constraint theory;Robustness;Spine;Smoothing methods;Predictive models;High performance computing","","377","","74","IEEE","11 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We examine how this information can be utilized more effectively for real-time operation as well as for subsequent decision making. This new information available in real time is different, both in quality and in quantity, than the real-time measurements available today. The promise of new and improved applications to operate the power system more reliably and efficiently has been recognized but is still in conceptual stages. Also, the present system to handle this real-time data has been recognized to be inadequate but even conceptual designs of such infrastructure needed to store and communicate the data are in their infancy. In this paper, we first suggest the requirements for an information infrastructure to handle ubiquitous phasor measurements recognizing that the quantity and rate of data would make it impossible to store all the data centrally as done today. Then we discuss the new and improved applications, classified into two categories: one is the set of automatic wide-area controls and the other is the set of control center (EMS) functions with special attention to the state estimator. Finally, given that the availability of phasor measurements will grow over time, the path for smooth transition from present-day systems and applications to those discussed here is delineated.

The resulting inference algorithms rely on pairwise registrations between the test image and individual training images. The training labels are then transferred to the test image and fused to compute the final segmentation of the test subject. Such label fusion methods have been shown to yield accurate segmentation, since the use of multiple registrations captures greater inter-subject anatomical variability and improves robustness against occasional registration failures. To the best of our knowledge, this manuscript presents the first comprehensive probabilistic framework that rigorously motivates label fusion as a segmentation approach. The proposed framework allows us to compare different label fusion algorithms theoretically and practically. In particular, recent label fusion or multiatlas segmentation algorithms are interpreted as special cases of our framework. We conduct two sets of experiments to validate the proposed methods. In the first set of experiments, we use 39 brain MRI scans - with manually segmented white matter, cerebral cortex, ventricles and subcortical structures - to compare different label fusion algorithms and the widely-used FreeSurfer whole-brain segmentation tool. Our results indicate that the proposed framework yields more accurate segmentation than FreeSurfer and previous label fusion algorithms. In a second experiment, we use brain MRI scans of 282 subjects to demonstrate that the proposed segmentation tool is sufficiently sensitive to robustly detect hippocampal volume changes in a study of aging and Alzheimer's Disease.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2050897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487420","Image parcellation;image registration;image segmentation","Fusion power generation;Image generation;Image segmentation;Testing;Robustness;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomedical imaging;Inference algorithms;Cerebral cortex;Aging","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Anatomic;Models, Neurological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","368","6","54","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, to well characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to find a set of visual features to represent its color, texture, and shape information and encode each feature into a vector. Therefore, we have a set of vectors in different spaces to represent the image. Conventional spectral-embedding algorithms cannot deal with such datum directly, so we have to concatenate these vectors together as a new vector. This concatenation is not physically meaningful because each feature has a specific statistical property. Therefore, we develop a new spectral-embedding algorithm, namely, multiview spectral embedding (MSE), which can encode different features in different ways, to achieve a physically meaningful embedding. In particular, MSE finds a low-dimensional embedding wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth, and MSE explores the complementary property of different views. Because there is no closed-form solution for MSE, we derive an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional embedding. Empirical evaluations based on the applications of image retrieval, video annotation, and document clustering demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2039566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415552","Dimensionality reduction;multiple views;spectral embedding","Computer vision;Shape;Image retrieval;Research and development;Educational technology;Educational programs;Layout;Closed-form solution;Iterative algorithms;Application software","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","365","1","30","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The new technique enjoys the advantages of the MIMO radar without sacrificing the main advantage of the phased-array radar which is the coherent processing gain at the transmitting side. The essence of the proposed technique is to partition the transmit array into a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Then, each subarray is used to coherently transmit a waveform which is orthogonal to the waveforms transmitted by other subarrays. Coherent processing gain can be achieved by designing a weight vector for each subarray to form a beam towards a certain direction in space. Moreover, the subarrays are combined jointly to form a MIMO radar resulting in higher angular resolution capabilities. Substantial improvements offered by the proposed phased-MIMO radar technique as compared to the phased-array and MIMO radar techniques are demonstrated analytically and by simulations through analyzing the corresponding beam patterns and the achievable output signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios.

We use boosting to construct improved privacy-pre serving synopses of an input database. These are data structures that yield, for a given set Q of queries over an input database, reasonably accurate estimates of the responses to every query in Q, even when the number of queries is much larger than the number of rows in the database. Given a base synopsis generator that takes a distribution on Q and produces a ""weak"" synopsis that yields ""good"" answers for a majority of the weight in Q, our Boosting for Queries algorithm obtains a synopsis that is good for all of Q. We ensure privacy for the rows of the database, but the boosting is performed on the queries. We also provide the first synopsis generators for arbitrary sets of arbitrary low-sensitivity queries, i.e., queries whose answers do not vary much under the addition or deletion of a single row. In the execution of our algorithm certain tasks, each incurring some privacy loss, are performed many times. To analyze the cumulative privacy loss, we obtain an O(ε2) bound on the expected privacy loss from a single e-differentially private mechanism. Combining this with evolution of confidence arguments from the literature, we get stronger bounds on the expected cumulative privacy loss due to multiple mechanisms, each of which provides e-differential privacy or one of its relaxations, and each of which operates on (potentially) different, adaptively chosen, databases.","0272-5428","978-1-4244-8525-3","10.1109/FOCS.2010.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5670947","","Databases;Privacy;Boosting;Data privacy;Generators;Accuracy;Data structures","","363","4","26","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has been largely due to the use of nonlinear equalizer structures implemented in part in the frequency domain by means of fast Fourier transforms, bringing the complexity close to that of OFDM. Here a nonlinear equalizer is formed with a linear filter to remove part of intersymbol interference, followed by a canceler of remaining interference by using previous detected data. Moreover, the capacity of SCM is similar to that of OFDM in highly dispersive channels only if a nonlinear equalizer is adopted at the receiver. Indeed, the study of efficient nonlinear frequency domain equalization techniques has further pushed the adoption of SCM in various standards. This tutorial paper aims at providing an overview of nonlinear equalization methods as a key ingredient in receivers of SCM for wideband transmission. We review both hybrid (with filters implemented both in time and frequency domain) and all-frequency-domain iterative structures. Application of nonlinear frequency domain equalizers to a multiple input multiple output scenario is also investigated, with a comparison of two architectures for interference reduction. We also present methods for channel estimation and alternatives for pilot insertion. The impact on SCM transmission of impairments such as phase noise, frequency offset and saturation due to high power amplifiers is also assessed.

The analysis relies on simple and intuitive observations about OMP and matrices which satisfy the RIP. For restricted classes of K-sparse signals (those that are highly compressible), a relaxed bound on the isometry constant is also established.

In photovoltaic (PV) applications, it is possible to remove the transformer in the inverter to reduce losses, costs, and size. Galvanic connection of the grid and the dc sources in transformerless systems can introduce additional ground currents due to the ground parasitic capacitance. These currents increase conducted and radiated electromagnetic emissions, harmonics injected in the utility grid, and losses. Amplitude and spectrum of the ground current depend on the converter topology, the switching strategy, and the resonant circuit formed by the ground capacitance, the converter, the ac filter, and the grid. In this paper, the ground current in a 1.5-kW PV installation is measured under different conditions and used to build a simulation model.

The interactions between the plastic fin and the IPMC actuator are also captured in the model. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is able to predict the motion of robotic fish for different tail dimensions. Since most of the model parameters are expressed in terms of fundamental physical properties and geometric dimensions, the model is expected to be instrumental in optimal design of the robotic fish.

Our goal in this paper is to obtain a representative (unbiased) sample of Facebook users by crawling its social graph. In this quest, we consider and implement several candidate techniques. Two approaches that are found to perform well are the Metropolis-Hasting random walk (MHRW) and a re-weighted random walk (RWRW). Both have pros and cons, which we demonstrate through a comparison to each other as well as to the ""ground-truth"" (UNI - obtained through true uniform sampling of FB userIDs). In contrast, the traditional Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and Random Walk (RW) perform quite poorly, producing substantially biased results. In addition to offline performance assessment, we introduce online formal convergence diagnostics to assess sample quality during the data collection process. We show how these can be used to effectively determine when a random walk sample is of adequate size and quality for subsequent use (i.e., when it is safe to cease sampling). Using these methods, we collect the first, to the best of our knowledge, unbiased sample of Facebook. Finally, we use one of our representative datasets, collected through MHRW, to characterize several key properties of Facebook.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462078","","Legged locomotion;Facebook;Sampling methods;Social network services;Convergence;Testing;Communications Society;Sociology;Internet;Character generation","","360","","36","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm implements two main steps: 1) semisupervised learning of the posterior class distributions followed by 2) segmentation, which infers an image of class labels from a posterior distribution built on the learned class distributions and on a Markov random field. The posterior class distributions are modeled using multinomial logistic regression, where the regressors are learned using both labeled and, through a graph-based technique, unlabeled samples. Such unlabeled samples are actively selected based on the entropy of the corresponding class label. The prior on the image of labels is a multilevel logistic model, which enforces segmentation results in which neighboring labels belong to the same class. The maximum a posteriori segmentation is computed by the α-expansion min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. Our experimental results, conducted using synthetic and real hyperspectral image data sets collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer system of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the regions of Indian Pines, IN, and Salinas Valley, CA, reveal that the proposed approach can provide classification accuracies that are similar or higher than those achieved by other supervised methods for the considered scenes. Our results also indicate that the use of a spatial prior can greatly improve the final results with respect to a case in which only the learned class densities are considered, confirming the importance of jointly considering spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral image segmentation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559437","Active learning;hyperspectral image classification;Markov random field (MRF);multilevel logistic (MLL) model;multinomial logistic regression (MLR);semisupervised learning","Hyperspectral imaging;Image segmentation;Pixel;Logistics;Training;Semisupervised learning","","358","2","39","IEEE","30 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We further prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP) gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to small entry-wise noise and robust to gross sparse errors.

Demand-side reserve is supplied by demand response providers (DRPs), which have the responsibility of aggregating and managing customer responses. A mixed-integer representation of reserve provided by DRPs and its associated cost function are used in the proposed stochastic model. The proposed stochastic model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) problem. The first-stage involves network-constrained unit commitment in the base case and the second-stage investigates security assurance in system scenarios. The proposed model would schedule reserves provided by DRPs and determine commitment states of generating units and their scheduled energy and spinning reserves in the scheduling horizon.

However, existing methods typically rely on a predefined spatial binning of the local descriptors to impose spatial information beyond a pure “bag-of-words” model, and thus may fail to capture the most informative space-time relationships. We propose to learn the shapes of space-time feature neighborhoods that are most discriminative for a given action category. Given a set of training videos, our method first extracts local motion and appearance features, quantizes them to a visual vocabulary, and then forms candidate neighborhoods consisting of the words associated with nearby points and their orientation with respect to the central interest point. Rather than dictate a particular scaling of the spatial and temporal dimensions to determine which points are near, we show how to learn the class-specific distance functions that form the most informative configurations. Descriptors for these variable-sized neighborhoods are then recursively mapped to higher-level vocabularies, producing a hierarchy of space-time configurations at successively broader scales.

However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems for structured prediction problems.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342426","Context;object recognition;image segmentation;3D brain segmentation;discriminative models;conditional random fields.","Brain;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Context modeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Markov random fields;Convergence;Shape;Humans;Layout","Algorithms;Animals;Brain;Horses;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Markov Chains;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Whole Body Imaging","356","12","56","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99% of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9% ± 14.2%) than for the intact arm ( 69.4% ± 13.1%). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1% ± 4.1%, compared to 84.4% ± 7.2% for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5% ± 4.9%.

An operating mode for low phase current frequencies which enables MMLCs to magnetize and start induction machines with quadratic torque loads is presented and the achievable torque-speed characteristic is derived. It is also shown that rotor flux optimization also reduces the capacitor voltage ripple at low torque. The method has successfully been tested in an experimental converter.","2329-3748","978-1-4244-5286-6","10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617802","","Capacitors;Converters;Torque;Inductance;Rotors;Induction motors","","355","12","11","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the underlying implementation and performance of clouds are very different from those at traditional supercomputing centers. It is therefore critical to evaluate the performance of HPC applications in today's cloud environments to understand the tradeoffs inherent in migrating to the cloud. This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation to date comparing conventional HPC platforms to Amazon EC2, using real applications representative of the workload at a typical supercomputing center.

Alternatively, in a problem of recursively reconstructing time sequences of sparse spatial signals, one may use the support estimate from the previous time instant as the “known” part. The idea of our proposed solution (modified-CS) is to solve a convex relaxation of the following problem: find the signal that satisfies the data constraint and is sparsest outside of $T$ . We obtain sufficient conditions for exact reconstruction using modified-CS. These are much weaker than those needed for compressive sensing (CS) when the sizes of the unknown part of the support and of errors in the known part are small compared to the support size. An important extension called regularized modified-CS (RegModCS) is developed which also uses prior signal estimate knowledge.

Many of the underlying algorithms rely on iterative reweighting schemes that produce more focal estimates as optimization progresses. Two such variants are iterative reweighted l1 and l2 minimization; however, some properties related to convergence and sparse estimation, as well as possible generalizations, are still not clearly understood or fully exploited. In this paper, we make the distinction between separable and non-separable iterative reweighting algorithms. The vast majority of existing methods are separable, meaning the weighting of a given coefficient at each iteration is only a function of that individual coefficient from the previous iteration (as opposed to dependency on all coefficients). We examine two such separable reweighting schemes: an l2 method from Chartrand and Yin (2008) and an l1 approach from Cande's (2008), elaborating on convergence results and explicit connections between them. We then explore an interesting non-separable alternative that can be implemented via either l2 or l1 reweighting and maintains several desirable properties relevant to sparse recovery despite a highly non-convex underlying cost function. For example, in the context of canonical sparse estimation problems, we prove uniform superiority of this method over the minimum l1 solution in that, 1) it can never do worse when implemented with reweighted l1, and 2) for any dictionary and sparsity profile, there will always exist cases where it does better. These results challenge the prevailing reliance on strictly convex (and separable) penalty functions for finding sparse solutions. We then derive a new non-separable variant with similar properties that exhibits further performance improvements in empirical tests. Finally, we address natural extensions to group sparsity problems and non-negative sparse coding.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419071","Compressive sensing (CS);iterative reweighting algorithms;sparse representations;underdetermined inverse problems","Iterative algorithms;Dictionaries;Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Cost function;Sparse matrices;Iterative methods;Testing;Inverse problems;Noise measurement","","352","1","31","IEEE","22 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the new regularization minimizes the Bregman divergence between the distribution of training samples and that of testing samples in the selected subspace, so it boosts the performance when training and testing samples are not independent and identically distributed. To test the effectiveness of the proposed regularization, we introduce it to popular subspace learning algorithms, e.g., principal components analysis (PCA) for cross-domain face modeling; and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), locality preserving projections (LPP), marginal Fisher's analysis (MFA), and discriminative locality alignment (DLA) for cross-domain face recognition and text categorization.

Specifically, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) method by conditioning on a sufficient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called RBLW, whose mean-squared error dominates that of LW for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage (OAS) estimator. Both RBLW and OAS estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to specified constants. The RBLW estimator provably dominates the LW method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the OAS approach can perform even better than RBLW, especially when n is much less than p .

To achieve consensus, dither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When the quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels), stochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with probability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that the mean-squared error (mse) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link weight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study dithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is bounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded quantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the supremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is accomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components: one along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to the consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale and supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the excursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the excursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use these probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore tradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization steps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy ¿ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer design with a numerical study.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2036046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5325701","Bounded quantizer;consensus;convergence;quantized;quantizer saturation;random link failures;sample path behavior;stochastic approximation","Convergence;Quantization;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Network topology;Stochastic resonance;Random variables;Costs;Stochastic processes;Application software","","351","","50","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most existing research focuses on reducing power consumptions of IDCs, the power management problem for minimizing the total electricity cost has been overlooked. This is an important problem faced by service providers, especially in the current multi-electricity market, where the price of electricity may exhibit time and location diversities. Further, for these service providers, guaranteeing quality of service (i.e. service level objectives-SLO) such as service delay guarantees to the end users is of paramount importance. This paper studies the problem of minimizing the total electricity cost under multiple electricity markets environment while guaranteeing quality of service geared to the location diversity and time diversity of electricity price.

The passive mixer-first architecture used here allows the impedance characteristics of the receiver's baseband circuits to be translated to the RF port of the receiver. Tuning the resistance at the baseband port allows for a real impedance match to the antenna. The addition of ""complex feedback"" between I and Q paths allows for matching to the imaginary component of the antenna impedance. By implementing both real and imaginary components with resistors in feedback around low noise baseband amplifiers, noise figure is also kept low. Tunable sampling capacitors on the baseband side of the passive mixer translate to tunable-Q filters on the RF port which allow for very good out-of-band linearity. Furthermore, the concept of in-band and out-of-band must be redefined as the impedance match and BPF center frequency move with the LO frequency, such that matching and filtering track the receive frequency. Additionally, 8-phase mixing is shown to provide significant benefits such as impedance matching range, rejection of blockers at LO harmonics, and lower noise figure (NF). Measurements from the receiver implemented in 65 nm CMOS show 70 dB of gain, NF as low as 3 dB, and 25 dBm out-of-band IIP3.

The approach infers user intent to stand, sit, or walk, by recognizing patterns in prosthesis sensor data in real time, without the need for instrumentation of the sound-side leg. Specifically, the intent recognizer utilizes time-based features extracted from frames of prosthesis signals, which are subsequently reduced to a lower dimensionality (for computational efficiency). These data are initially used to train intent models, which classify the patterns as standing, sitting, or walking. The trained models are subsequently used to infer the user's intent in real time. In addition to describing the generalized control approach, this paper describes the implementation of this approach on a single unilateral transfemoral amputee subject and demonstrates via experiments the effectiveness of the approach. In the real-time supervisory control experiments, the intent recognizer identified all 90 activity-mode transitions, switching the underlying middle-level controllers without any perceivable delay by the user.

Methods for this have two main aspects: the models used to represent the individual image sets; and the similarity metric used to compare the models. Here, we represent images as points in a linear or affine feature space and characterize each image set by a convex geometric region (the affine or convex hull) spanned by its feature points. Set dissimilarity is measured by geometric distances (distances of closest approach) between convex models. To reduce the influence of outliers we use robust methods to discard input points that are far from the fitted model. The kernel trick allows the approach to be extended to implicit feature mappings, thus handling complex and nonlinear manifolds of face images.

Recent mechanics-based models of these “active cannulas” are able to accurately describe the curve of the robot in free space, given the preformed tube curves and the linear and angular positions of the tube bases. However, in practical applications, where the active cannula must interact with its environment or apply controlled forces, a model that accounts for deformation under external loading is required. In this paper, we apply geometrically exact rod theory to produce a forward kinematic model that accurately describes large deflections due to a general collection of externally applied point and/or distributed wrench loads. This model accommodates arbitrarily many tubes, with each having a general preshaped curve. It also describes the independent torsional deformation of the individual tubes. Experimental results are provided for both point and distributed loads. Average tip error under load was 2.91 mm (1.5% - 3% of total robot length), which is similar to the accuracy of existing free-space models.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2010.2062570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559519","Active cannula;concentric-tube robot;continuum robot;Cosserat-rod theory","Electron tubes;Robots;Load modeling;Equations;Shape;Mathematical model;Kinematics","","347","14","23","IEEE","30 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underground is a challenging environment for wireless communications since the propagation medium is no longer air but soil, rock and water.

New techniques using magnetic induction (MI) create constant channel condition and can accomplish the communication with small size coils. In this paper, detailed analysis on the path loss and the bandwidth of the MI system in underground soil medium is provided. Based on the channel analysis, the MI waveguide technique for communication is developed in order to reduce the high path loss of the traditional EM wave system and the ordinary MI system.

Multicarrier transmission schemes like OFDM use block channel equalization in the frequency domain, efficiently implemented as a fast Fourier transform, and these channel estimates can directly be used to identify targets based on Fourier analysis across subsequent blocks. In this paper, we derive the exact matched filter formulation for passive radar using OFDM waveforms. We then show that the current approach using Fourier analysis across block channel estimates is equivalent to the matched filter, based on a piecewise constant assumption on the Doppler-induced phase rotation in the time domain. We next present high-resolution algorithms based on the same assumption: first we implement MUSIC as a 2-D spectral estimator using spatial smoothing; then we use the new concept of compressed sensing to identify targets.

Each kinematic feature, when computed from the optical flow of a sequence of images, gives rise to a spatiotemporal pattern. It is then assumed that the representative dynamics of the optical flow are captured by these spatiotemporal patterns in the form of dominant kinematic trends or kinematic modes. These kinematic modes are computed by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the spatiotemporal volumes of the kinematic features. For classification, we propose the use of multiple instance learning (MIL) in which each action video is represented by a bag of kinematic modes.

In this paper, we study one of these methods, the so-called Iterative Hard Thresholding algorithm. While this method has strong theoretical performance guarantees whenever certain theoretical properties hold, empirical studies show that the algorithm's performance degrades significantly, whenever the conditions fail. What is more, in this regime, the algorithm also often fails to converge. As we are here interested in the application of the method to real world problems, in which it is not known in general, whether the theoretical conditions are satisfied or not, we suggest a simple modification that guarantees the convergence of the method, even in this regime. With this modification, empirical evidence suggests that the algorithm is faster than many other state-of-the-art approaches while showing similar performance. What is more, the modified algorithm retains theoretical performance guarantees similar to the original algorithm.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419091","Sparse signal modeling;compressed sensing (CS);iterative hard thresholding;sparse inverse problems","Stability;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Compressed sensing;Sampling methods;Vectors;Signal processing;Iterative methods;Inverse problems;Sparse matrices","","342","2","23","IEEE","22 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previously, a main concern of Internet applications developers was deployment and hosting of applications, because it required acquisition of a server with a fixed capacity able to handle the expected application peak demand and the installation and maintenance of the whole software infrastructure of the platform supporting the application. Furthermore, server was underutilized because peak traffic happens only at specific times. With the advent of the Cloud, deployment and hosting became cheaper and easier with the use of pay-peruse flexible elastic infrastructure services offered by Cloud providers. Because several Cloud providers are available, each one offering different pricing models and located in different geographic regions, a new concern of application developers is selecting providers and data center locations for applications. However, there is a lack of tools that enable developers to evaluate requirements of large-scale Cloud applications in terms of geographic distribution of both computing servers and user workloads. To fill this gap in tools for evaluation and modeling of Cloud environments and applications, we propose CloudAnalyst. It was developed to simulate large-scale Cloud applications with the purpose of studying the behavior of such applications under various deployment configurations.

Interestingly, keeping a user in the loop leads to simpler and highly parallelizable energy functions, allowing us to work with significantly more images per group. However, unlike the interactive single image counterpart, a user cannot be expected to exhaustively examine all cutouts (from tens of images) returned by the system to make corrections. Hence, we propose iCoseg, an automatic recommendation system that intelligently recommends where the user should scribble next. We introduce and make publicly available the largest co-segmentation datasetyet, the CMU-Cornell iCoseg Dataset, with 38 groups, 643 images, and pixelwise hand-annotated groundtruth. Through machine experiments and real user studies with our developed interface, we show that iCoseg can intelligently recommend regions to scribble on, and users following these recommendations can achieve good quality cutouts with significantly lower time and effort than exhaustively examining all cutouts.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540080","","Image segmentation;Machine intelligence;Iterative algorithms;Intelligent systems;Facebook;Smart pixels","","340","10","28","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the authors propose a single-phase H-bridge multilevel converter for PV systems governed by a new integrated fuzzy logic controller (FLC)/modulator. The novelties of the proposed system are the use of a fully FLC (not requiring any optimal PWM switching-angle generator and proportional-integral controller) and the use of an H-bridge power-sharing algorithm. Most of the required signal processing is performed by a mixed-mode field-programmable gate array, resulting in a fully integrated System-on-Chip controller.

Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents a new approach towards nontechnical loss (NTL) detection in power utilities using an artificial intelligence based technique, support vector machine (SVM). The main motivation of this study is to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in peninsular Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the distribution sector due to abnormalities and fraud activities, i.e., electricity theft. The fraud detection model (FDM) developed in this research study preselects suspected customers to be inspected onsite fraud based on irregularities in consumption behavior. This approach provides a method of data mining, which involves feature extraction from historical customer consumption data. This SVM based approach uses customer load profile information and additional attributes to expose abnormal behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities. The result yields customer classes which are used to shortlist potential suspects for onsite inspection based on significant behavior that emerges due to fraud activities. Model testing is performed using historical kWh consumption data for three towns within peninsular Malaysia. Feedback from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite inspection indicates that the proposed method is more effective compared to the current actions taken by them. With the implementation of this new fraud detection system TNBD's detection hitrate will increase from 3% to 60%.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2030890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286297","Electricity theft;intelligent system;load profiling;nontechnical loss;pattern classification","Support vector machines;Energy consumption;Inspection;Face detection;Area measurement;Electric variables measurement;Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Feature extraction;Testing","","338","2","46","IEEE","13 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose a three-stage process building on a number of recent advances. The first stage obtains an initial estimate of the 2D articulation and viewpoint of the person from single frames. The second stage allows early data association across frames based on tracking-by-detection. These two stages successfully accumulate the available 2D image evidence into robust estimates of 2D limb positions over short image sequences (= tracklets). The third and final stage uses those tracklet-based estimates as robust image observations to reliably recover 3D pose.

First, it is a unique utilization of particle trajectories for modeling crowded scenes, in which we propose new and efficient representative trajectories for modeling arbitrarily complicated crowd flows. Second, chaotic dynamics are introduced into the crowd context to characterize complicated crowd motions by regulating a set of chaotic invariant features, which are reliably computed and used for detecting anomalies. Third, a probabilistic framework for anomaly detection and localization is formulated. The overall work-flow begins with particle advection based on optical flow. Then particle trajectories are clustered to obtain representative trajectories for a crowd flow. Next, the chaotic dynamics of all representative trajectories are extracted and quantified using chaotic invariants known as maximal Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension. Probabilistic model is learned from these chaotic feature set, and finally, a maximum likelihood estimation criterion is adopted to identify a query video of a scene as normal or abnormal. Furthermore, an effective anomaly localization algorithm is designed to locate the position and size of an anomaly.

Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions.

However, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, SVMs produce suboptimal classification models. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Therefore, although the existing class imbalance learning (CIL) methods can make SVMs less sensitive to class imbalance, they can still suffer from the problem of outliers and noise. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs) is a variant of the SVM algorithm, which has been proposed to handle the problem of outliers and noise. In FSVMs, training examples are assigned different fuzzy-membership values based on their importance, and these membership values are incorporated into the SVM learning algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers and noise. However, like the normal SVM algorithm, FSVMs can also suffer from the problem of class imbalance. In this paper, we present a method to improve FSVMs for CIL (called FSVM-CIL), which can be used to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noise. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed FSVM-CIL method on ten real-world imbalanced datasets and compared its performance with five existing CIL methods, which are available for normal SVM training. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FSVM-CIL method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in datasets.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2042721","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5409611","Class imbalance learning (CIL);fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs);outliers;support vector machines (SVMs)","Support vector machines;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Machine learning algorithms;Solids;Noise reduction","","334","","60","IEEE","8 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model is used to motivate a community-matching strategy for efficiently identifying and tracking dynamic communities. Evaluations on synthetic graphs containing embedded events demonstrate that this strategy can successfully track communities over time in volatile networks.

The algorithm is inspired by biological mechanisms of motion-based perceptual grouping and extends a discriminant formulation of center-surround saliency previously proposed for static imagery. Under this formulation, the saliency of a location is equated to the power of a predefined set of features to discriminate between the visual stimuli in a center and a surround window, centered at that location. The features are spatiotemporal video patches and are modeled as dynamic textures, to achieve a principled joint characterization of the spatial and temporal components of saliency. The combination of discriminant center-surround saliency with the modeling power of dynamic textures yields a robust, versatile, and fully unsupervised spatiotemporal saliency algorithm, applicable to scenes with highly dynamic backgrounds and moving cameras. The related problem of background subtraction is treated as the complement of saliency detection, by classifying nonsalient (with respect to appearance and motion dynamics) points in the visual field as background. The algorithm is tested for background subtraction on challenging sequences, and shown to substantially outperform various state-of-the-art techniques. Quantitatively, its average error rate is almost half that of the closest competitor.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967608","Spatiotemporal saliency;background subtraction;dynamic backgrounds;motion saliency;dynamic texture;discriminant center-surround architecture;video modeling.","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Layout;Cameras;Robustness;Motion detection;Optical filters;Testing;Error analysis;Birds;Snow","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Markov Chains;Models, Theoretical;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;ROC Curve;Video Recording;Vision, Ocular;Visual Perception","332","3","32","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the restoration of these images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based upon multiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research area, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based upon an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization [or maximum a posteriori (MAP)] restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson log-likelihood with a (nonsmooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to hard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is nonquadratic and nonseparable, the regularizer is nonsmooth, and there is a nonnegativity constraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization problems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based analysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. We study sufficient conditions for convergence and show that these are satisfied, either under total-variation or frame-based (analysis and synthesis) regularization. The resulting algorithms are shown to outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of speed and restoration accuracy.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2053941","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492199","Alternating direction methods;augmented Lagrangian;convex optimization;image deconvolution;image restoration;Poisson images","Image restoration;Additive noise;Biomedical imaging;Optimization methods;Sufficient conditions;Lagrangian functions;Deconvolution;Image reconstruction;Gaussian noise;Permission","Algorithms;Image Enhancement;Pattern Recognition, Automated","332","","61","IEEE","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the operators of PSO are originally designed in an n-dimensional continuous space, the advancement of using PSO to find solutions in a discrete space is at a slow pace. In this paper, a novel set-based PSO (S-PSO) method for the solutions of some combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) in discrete space is presented. The proposed S-PSO features the following characteristics. First, it is based on using a set-based representation scheme that enables S-PSO to characterize the discrete search space of COPs. Second, the candidate solution and velocity are defined as a crisp set, and a set with possibilities, respectively. All arithmetic operators in the velocity and position updating rules used in the original PSO are replaced by the operators and procedures defined on crisp sets, and sets with possibilities in S-PSO. The S-PSO method can thus follow a similar structure to the original PSO for searching in a discrete space. Based on the proposed S-PSO method, most of the existing PSO variants, such as the global version PSO, the local version PSO with different topologies, and the comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO), can be extended to their corresponding discrete versions. These discrete PSO versions based on S-PSO are tested on two famous COPs: the traveling salesman problem and the multidimensional knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the discrete version of the CLPSO algorithm based on S-PSO is promising.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2009.2030331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299261","Combinatorial optimization problem;discrete space;multidimensional knapsack problem;particle swarm optimization;traveling salesman problem","Particle swarm optimization;Optimization methods;Traveling salesman problems;Multidimensional systems;Computer science;Iterative algorithms;Arithmetic;Topology;Testing;Space exploration","","331","","51","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to address this problem by the introduction of a complete representation framework, which is referred to as zSlices-based general type-2 fuzzy systems. The proposed approach will lead to a significant reduction in both the complexity and the computational requirements for general type-2 FLSs, while it offers the capability to represent complex general type-2 fuzzy sets.

This paper focuses on the issue of ship detection from spaceborne optical images (SDSOI). Although advantages of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) result in that most of current ship detection approaches are based on SAR images, disadvantages of SAR still exist, such as the limited number of SAR sensors, the relatively long revisit cycle, and the relatively lower resolution. With the increasing number of and the resulting improvement in continuous coverage of the optical sensors, SDSOI can partly overcome the shortcomings of SAR-based approaches and should be investigated to help satisfy the requirements of real-time ship monitoring. In SDSOI, several factors such as clouds, ocean waves, and small islands affect the performance of ship detection. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical complete and operational SDSOI approach based on shape and texture features, which is considered a sequential coarse-to-fine elimination process of false alarms. First, simple shape analysis is adopted to eliminate evident false candidates generated by image segmentation with global and local information and to extract ship candidates with missing alarms as low as possible. Second, a novel semisupervised hierarchical classification approach based on various features is presented to distinguish between ships and nonships to remove most false alarms. Besides a complete and operational SDSOI approach, the other contributions of our approach include the following three aspects: 1) it classifies ship candidates by using their class probability distributions rather than the direct extracted features; 2) the relevant classes are automatically built by the samples’ appearances and their feature attribute in a semisupervised mode; and 3) besides commonly used shape and texture features, a new texture operator, i.e., local multiple patterns, is introduced to enhance the representation ability of the feature set in feature extraction. Experimental results of SDSOI on a large image set captured by optical sensors from multiple satellites show that our approach is effective in distinguishing between ships and nonships, and obtains a satisfactory ship detection performance.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2046330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454348","Hierarchical classification;shape analysis;ship detection;spaceborne optical images;texture analysis","Marine vehicles;Optical detectors;Shape;Optical sensors;Synthetic aperture radar;Spaceborne radar;Radar detection;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Aquaculture","","331","","48","IEEE","26 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multimode operations and multiloop designs are vital for such multiport converters. However, control design is difficult for a multiport converter to achieve multifunctional power management because of various cross-coupled control loops. Since there are various modes of operation, it is challenging to define different modes and to further implement autonomous mode transition based on the energy state of the three power ports. A competitive method is used to realize smooth and seamless mode transition. Multiport converter has plenty of interacting control loops due to integrated power trains. It is difficult to design close-loop controls without proper decoupling method. A detailed approach is provided utilizing state-space averaging method to obtain the converter model under different modes of operation, and then a decoupling network is introduced to allow separate controller designs. Simulation and experimental results verify the converter control design and power management during various operational modes.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2009.2033926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280327","DC–DC converters;digital control;mode transition;multi-input multi-output (MIMO);multiport;small-signal modeling;state-space averaging","DC-DC power converters;Satellites;Energy management;Power system modeling;Topology;Batteries;Control design;MIMO;Switching converters;Centralized control","","329","3","34","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a new categorization for concept drift, separating drifts according to different criteria into mutually exclusive and nonheterogeneous categories. Moreover, although ensembles of learning machines have been used to learn in the presence of concept drift, there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for that and which of their features can contribute or not for that. As diversity is one of these features, we present a diversity analysis in the presence of different types of drifts. We show that, before the drift, ensembles with less diversity obtain lower test errors. On the other hand, it is a good strategy to maintain highly diverse ensembles to obtain lower test errors shortly after the drift independent on the type of drift, even though high diversity is more important for more severe drifts. Longer after the drift, high diversity becomes less important. Diversity by itself can help to reduce the initial increase in error caused by a drift, but does not provide the faster recovery from drifts in long-term.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5156502","Concept drift;online learning;neural network ensembles;diversity.","Machine learning;Testing;Application software;Training data;Information filtering;Industrial training;Neural networks;Time factors;Computer industry;Industrial control","","329","","51","IEEE","6 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional devices are often criticized because they are limited to reproducing predefined movement patterns. Research on patient-cooperative control strategies aims at improving robotic behavior. Robots should support patients only as much as needed and stimulate them to produce maximal voluntary efforts. This paper presents a patient-cooperative strategy that allows patients to influence the timing of their leg movements along a physiologically meaningful path. In this ¿path control¿ strategy, compliant virtual walls keep the patient's legs within a ¿tunnel¿ around the desired spatial path. Additional supportive torques enable patients to move along the path with reduced effort. Graphical feedback provides visual training instructions. The path control strategy was evaluated with 10 healthy subjects and 15 subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury. The spatio-temporal characteristics of recorded kinematic data showed that subjects walked with larger temporal variability with the new strategy. Electromyographic data indicated that subjects were training more actively. A majority of iSCI subjects was able to actively control their gait timing. Thus, the strategy allows patients to train walking while being helped rather than controlled by the robot.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2033061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280197","Control;gait rehabilitation;patient-cooperative;rehabilitation robotics","Rehabilitation robotics;Intelligent robots;Spinal cord injury;Legged locomotion;Robot sensing systems;Intelligent systems;Intelligent sensors;Hospitals;Muscles;Timing","Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Leg;Male;Man-Machine Systems;Physical Therapy Modalities;Robotics;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","328","1","35","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fast-paced time-varying observer estimates parameters, such as the state of charge and terminal voltage, and polarization effects. The slow-paced time-varying observer estimates the SOH in terms of the capacity fade and resistance deterioration. The convergence of the proposed observer was proved by the Lyapunov equation.

Two distributed control laws are proposed and analyzed. The first control law applies a passivity approach for distributed attitude synchronization. The control law guarantees attitude synchronization without the requirement for absolute angular velocity measurements and relative angular velocity measurements between neighboring rigid bodies. The second control law incorporates a time-varying reference attitude, where the reference attitude is allowed to be available to only a subset of the group members under general directed information exchange. The control law guarantees that all rigid bodies track the time-varying reference attitude as long as a virtual leader whose attitude is the time-varying reference attitude has a directed path to all other rigid bodies in the group.

This survey aims to provide the reader with a significant overview of the LMI techniques that are used in control systems for tackling optimization problems over polynomials, describing approaches such as decomposition in sum of squares, Positivstellensatz, theory of moments, Pólya's theorem, and matrix dilation. Moreover, it aims to provide a collection of the essential problems in control systems where these LMI techniques are used, such as stability and performance investigations in nonlinear systems, uncertain systems, time-delay systems, and genetic regulatory networks.

We perform asymptotically optimal Bayesian inference using belief propagation (BP) decoding, which represents the CS encoding matrix as a graphical model. Fast computation is obtained by reducing the size of the graphical model with sparse encoding matrices. To decode a length-N signal containing K large coefficients, our CS-BP decoding algorithm uses O(K log(N)) measurements and O(N log2(N)) computation.

Differential evolution (DE) is one of the very fast and robust evolutionary algorithms for global optimization. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a relatively new optimization. Mathematical models of biogeography describe how a species arises, migrates from one habitat (Island) to another, or gets extinct. This algorithm searches for the global optimum mainly through two steps: migration and mutation. This paper presents combination of DE and BBO (DE/BBO) to improve the quality of solution and convergence speed. DE/BBO improves the searching ability of DE utilizing BBO algorithm effectively and can generate the promising candidate solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified on four different test systems, both small and large. Considering the quality of the solution and convergence speed obtained, this method seems to be a promising alternative approach for solving the ELD problems in practical power system.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2043270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431065","Biogeography-based optimization;differential evolution;economic load dispatch;prohibited operating zone;ramp rate limits;valve-point loading","Constraint optimization;Power generation economics;Thermal loading;Propagation losses;Robustness;Evolutionary computation;Mathematical model;Biogeography;Genetic mutations;System testing","","326","","28","IEEE","15 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional maximal-weight scheduling (MWS), although throughput-optimal, is difficult to implement in distributed networks.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheduling algorithm that can achieve the maximal throughput distributively. Some of the major advantages of the algorithm are that it applies to a very general interference model and that it is simple, distributed, and asynchronous. Furthermore, the algorithm is combined with congestion control to achieve the optimal utility and fairness of competing flows. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. Also, the adaptive CSMA scheduling is a modular MAC-layer algorithm that can be combined with various protocols in the transport layer and network layer.

Recently proposed methods take different approaches to the problem and yet their denoising performances are comparable. A pertinent question then to ask is whether there is a theoretical limit to denoising performance and, more importantly, are we there yet? As camera manufacturers continue to pack increasing numbers of pixels per unit area, an increase in noise sensitivity manifests itself in the form of a noisier image. We study the performance bounds for the image denoising problem. Our work in this paper estimates a lower bound on the mean squared error of the denoised result and compares the performance of current state-of-the-art denoising methods with this bound. We show that despite the phenomenal recent progress in the quality of denoising algorithms, some room for improvement still remains for a wide class of general images, and at certain signal-to-noise levels.

In this paper we present a co-optimization formulation of the generation unit commitment and transmission switching problem while ensuring N-1 reliability. We show that the optimal topology of the network can vary from hour to hour. We also show that optimizing the topology can change the optimal unit commitment schedule. This problem is large and computationally complex even for medium sized systems. We present decomposition and computational approaches to solving this problem. Results are presented for the IEEE RTS 96 test case.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2037232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401077","Generation unit commitment;integer programming;power generation dispatch;power system economics;power system reliability;power transmission control;power transmission economics","Network topology;Costs;Mesh generation;Smart grids;Power system economics;Power transmission;Voltage;Load flow;Power transmission lines;Distributed parameter circuits","","322","","37","IEEE","29 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although it is notoriously difficult to derive general end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or adhoc networks, the transmission capacity (TC) framework allows for quantification of achievable single-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/MAC-layer model. By using stochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, the relationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability of transmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed-often fairly simply-in terms of the key network parameters. The basic model and analytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with path loss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity (via lower and upper bounds on outage probability). We then introduce random channels (fading/shadowing) and give TC and outage approximations for an arbitrary channel distribution, as well as exact results for the special cases of Rayleigh and Nakagami fading. We then apply these results to show how TC can be used to better understand scheduling, power control, and the deployment of multiple antennas in a decentralized network. The paper closes by discussing shortcomings in the model as well as future research directions.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2010.093010.090478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599263","Transmission capacity;wireless networks;ad hoc networks;stochastic geometry","Interference;Transmitters;Fading;Markov processes;Receivers;Upper bound;Wireless networks","","322","","71","IEEE","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509636","","Simultaneous localization and mapping;Optimization methods;Data mining;Streaming media;Information filtering;Information filters;Probability distribution;Performance analysis;Computational modeling;Performance evaluation","","322","9","22","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a difference with classical solutions, based on the installation of crowbar circuits, this operation mode permits to keep the inverter connected to the generator, something that would permit the injection of power to the grid during the fault, as the new grid codes demand. A theoretical study of the dynamical behavior of the rotor voltage is also developed, in order to show that the voltage at the rotor terminals required for the control strategy implementation remains under controllable limits.

Active network management (ANM) will play a major role in this but there is a continuing need to demonstrate the benefit in facilitating connection of new generation without the need for traditional reinforcements. This paper proposes a multi-period AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based technique for evaluating the maximum capacity of new variable distributed generation able to be connected to a distribution network when ANM control strategies are in place. The ANM schemes embedded into the OPF include coordinated voltage control, adaptive power factor and energy curtailment. A generic U.K. medium voltage distribution network is analyzed using coincident demand and wind availability data derived from hourly time-series. Results clearly show that very high penetration levels of new variable generation capacity can be achieved by considering ANM strategies compared to the widely used passive operation (i.e., ""fit and forget"").

Due to the complexity of widely dispersed assets and the interdependences among computer, communication, and power infrastructures, the requirement to meet security and quality compliance on operations is a challenging issue. In recent years, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) established a cybersecurity standard that requires utilities' compliance on cybersecurity of control systems. This standard identifies several cyber-related vulnerabilities that exist in control systems and recommends several remedial actions (e.g., best practices). In this paper, a comprehensive survey on cybersecurity of critical infrastructures is reported. A supervisory control and data acquisition security framework with the following four major components is proposed: (1) real-time monitoring; (2) anomaly detection; (3) impact analysis; and (4) mitigation strategies. In addition, an attack-tree-based methodology for impact analysis is developed. The attack-tree formulation based on power system control networks is used to evaluate system-, scenario -, and leaf-level vulnerabilities by identifying the system's adversary objectives. The leaf vulnerability is fundamental to the methodology that involves port auditing or password strength evaluation. The measure of vulnerabilities in the power system control framework is determined based on existing cybersecurity conditions, and then, the vulnerability indices are evaluated.","1558-2426","","10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2048028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477189","Attack tree;cybersecurity;defense systems;power system control;security vulnerability","Computer security;SCADA systems;National security;Communication system control;Control systems;Power system control;Communication system security;Power system security;Power system reliability;Best practices","","321","5","88","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here we develop the Linear Influence Model where rather than requiring the knowledge of the social network and then modeling the diffusion by predicting which node will influence which other nodes in the network, we focus on modeling the global influence of a node on the rate of diffusion through the (implicit) network. We model the number of newly infected nodes as a function of which other nodes got infected in the past. For each node we estimate an influence function that quantifies how many subsequent infections can be attributed to the influence of that node over time. A nonparametric formulation of the model leads to a simple least squares problem that can be solved on large datasets. We validate our model on a set of 500 million tweets and a set of 170 million news articles and blog posts. We show that the Linear Influence Model accurately models influences of nodes and reliably predicts the temporal dynamics of information diffusion.

In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed.

Unlike traditional approaches, which attempt to map from appearance features to depth directly, we first perform a semantic segmentation of the scene and use the semantic labels to guide the 3D reconstruction. This approach provides several advantages: By knowing the semantic class of a pixel or region, depth and geometry constraints can be easily enforced (e.g., “sky” is far away and “ground” is horizontal). In addition, depth can be more readily predicted by measuring the difference in appearance with respect to a given semantic class. For example, a tree will have more uniform appearance in the distance than it does close up. Finally, the incorporation of semantic features allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results with a significantly simpler model than previous works.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539823","","Layout;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Computer science;Pixel;Predictive models;Computer vision;Roads;Image segmentation;Application software","","320","8","21","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subsequently, digital beamforming is used to capture the desired user signal. In this paper, we consider the design of the analog and digital beamforming coefficients, for the case of narrowband signals. We aim to cancel interfering signals in the analog domain, thus minimizing the required ADC resolution. For a given resolution, we will propose the optimal analog beamformer to minimize the mean squared error between the desired user and its receiver estimate. Practical analog beamformers employ only a quantized number of phase shifts. For this case, we propose a design technique to successively approximate the desired overall beamformer by a linear combination of implementable analog beamformers. Finally, an online channel estimation technique is introduced to estimate the required statistics of the wireless channel on which the optimal beamformers are based.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2048321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447703","ADC power consumption;analog beamforming;matching pursuit;passive RF phase shifters","Array signal processing;MIMO;Channel estimation;Radio frequency;Signal resolution;Analog-digital conversion;Receivers;RF signals;Baseband;Signal design","","320","8","25","IEEE","15 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In fact, the contour mapping measure is as predictive of human judgements as human subjects are of each other. Region-based methods, and contour methods such as Hausdorff distances that do not respect the ordering of points on shape boundaries are significantly less consistent with human judgements.

NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), currently planned for launch in 2015, is specifically intended to quantify the amount of change in ice sheets and sea ice and provide key insights into their behavior. It will achieve these objectives through the use of precise laser measurements of surface elevation, building on the groundbreaking capabilities of its predecessor, the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In particular, ICESat-2 will measure the temporal and spatial character of ice sheet elevation change to enable assessment of ice sheet mass balance and examination of the underlying mechanisms that control it. The precision of ICESat-2's elevation measurement will also allow for accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard height, from which sea ice thickness and its temporal changes can be estimated. ICESat-2 will provide important information on other components of the Earth System as well, most notably large-scale vegetation biomass estimates through the measurement of vegetation canopy height. When combined with the original ICESat observations, ICESat-2 will provide ice change measurements across more than a 15-year time span. Its significantly improved laser system will also provide observations with much greater spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy than has ever been possible before.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2034765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461025","Ice sheets;ICESat-2;laser altimetry;NASA;satellite;sea ice;vegetation","Laser radar;Sea measurements;Sea ice;Satellites;Earth;Clouds;Thickness measurement;Vegetation;Spatial resolution;Aircraft","","318","","71","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The developed DPC scheme is based on the predictive control strategy to achieve direct control of instantaneous active and reactive power of the converter. For this purpose, at the beginning of each switching period, the required rectifier average voltage vector allowing the cancellation of active and reactive power tracking errors, at the end of the switching period, is calculated by means of predictive control algorithm in the sense of deadbeat control. The main advantages of the proposed control, compared to the works published in this subject, are that no need to use predefined switching table and voltage vector or virtual flux position, PI-based active and reactive power control loops are not necessary and constant-switching frequency. The proposed predictive direct power control was tested both in simulations and experimentally and compared with DPC using switching table. Results have proved excellent performance, and verify the validity of the proposed DPC scheme, which is much better than conventional DPC using switching table.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2009.2028731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204139","Deadbeat control;direct power control;instantaneous powers;predictive control;pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier;space-vector modulation (SVM);unity power factor","Space vector pulse width modulation;Power control;Rectifiers;Support vector machines;Reactive power control;Predictive control;Voltage control;Switching frequency;Frequency modulation;Error correction","","316","","27","IEEE","18 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Problems include 1) nonsimultaneous directional measurements, 2) correlated bit streams, and 3) low bit rate of secret key generation. This paper introduces high-rate uncorrelated bit extraction (HRUBE), a framework for interpolating, transforming for decorrelation, and encoding channel measurements using a multibit adaptive quantization scheme which allows multiple bits per component. We present an analysis of the probability of bit disagreement in generated secret keys, and we use experimental data to demonstrate the HRUBE scheme and to quantify its experimental performance. As two examples, the implemented HRUBE system can achieve 22 bits per second at a bit disagreement rate of 2.2 percent, or 10 bits per second at a bit disagreement rate of 0.54 percent.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2009.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4967595","Wireless networks;multipath fading;physical layer;cryptography;key generation.","Character generation;Public key cryptography;Interference;Frequency;Multipath channels;Filters;Jamming;Bit rate;Data mining;Decorrelation","","315","13","27","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we describe a new region duplication detection method that is robust to distortions of the duplicated regions. Our method starts by estimating the transform between matched scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) keypoints, which are insensitive to geometrical and illumination distortions, and then finds all pixels within the duplicated regions after discounting the estimated transforms.

State-of-the-art Local Positioning Systems (LPS) require a complex sensor-network infrastructure to locate with enough accuracy and coverage. Alternatively, Inertial Measuring Units (IMU) can be used to estimate the movement of a person; a methodology that is called Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR). In this paper, we describe and implement a Kalman-based framework, called INS-EKF-ZUPT (IEZ), to estimate the position and attitude of a person while walking. IEZ makes use of an Extended Kalman filter (EKF), an INS mechanization algorithm, a Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) methodology, as well as, a stance detection algorithm. As the IEZ methodology is not able to estimate the heading and its drift (non-observable variables), then several methods are used for heading drift reduction: ZARU, HDR and Compass. The main contribution of the paper is the integration of the heading drift reduction algorithms into a Kalman-based IEZ platform, which represents an extended PDR methodology (IEZ+) valid for operation in indoor spaces with local magnetic disturbances. The IEZ+ PDR methodology was tested in several simulated and real indoor scenarios with a low-performance IMU mounted on the foot. The positioning errors were about 1% of the total travelled distance, which are good figures if compared with other works using IMUs of higher performance.","","978-1-4244-7158-4","10.1109/WPNC.2010.5649300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5649300","","Acceleration;Measurement uncertainty;Foot;Kalman filters;Accelerometers;Gyroscopes;Navigation","","313","4","14","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fixed speed wind generators suffer greatly from meeting the requirements of new wind farm grid code, because they are largely dependent on reactive power. Integration of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices is a solution to overcome that problem, though it definitely increases the overall cost. Therefore, in this paper, we focuses on a new wind farm topology, where series or parallel connected fixed speed WTGSs are installed with variable speed wind turbine (VSWT) driven permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). VSWT-PMSG uses a fully controlled frequency converter for grid interfacing and it has abilities to control its reactive power as well as to provide maximum power to the grid. Suitable control strategy is developed in this paper for the multilevel frequency converter of VSWT-PMSG. A real grid code defined in the power system is considered to analyze the low voltage ride through (LVRT) characteristic of both fixed and variable speed WTGSs. Moreover, dynamic performance of the system is also evaluated using real wind speed data. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed topology can be a cost effective solution to augment the LVRT requirement as well as to minimize voltage fluctuation of both fixed and variable speed WTGSs.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2030421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262959","Frequency converter;low voltage ride through (LVRT);multilevel converter/inverter;permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG);voltage source converter (VSC);wind generator","Wind turbines;Wind farms;Magnetic variables control;Wind energy generation;Wind speed;Flexible AC transmission systems;Costs;Topology;Frequency conversion;Power system simulation","","310","1","36","IEEE","25 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complexity associated with a richly scattering environment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to predict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in space, time, and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state between a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for building practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We begin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process, which is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with a richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and incorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial manipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing algorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their underlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is suited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is motivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but exploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic log likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation rate. We validate both proposed protocols through experimentations using a customized 802.11a platform, and show for the typical WiFi channel that reliable secret key establishment can be accomplished at rates on the order of 10 b/s.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2043187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422766","Information-theoretic security;key generation;PHY layer security","Fading;Rayleigh scattering;Rayleigh channels;Predictive models;Decorrelation;Frequency;Transmitters;Wireless application protocol;Rician channels;Gaussian processes","","308","6","62","IEEE","1 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mode transfer tests are conducted with an inverter-simulated grid to define the proper transfer procedures.

With the designed current sharing scheme, the output current is equally shared among paralleled inverters without noticeable circulating current.

In other words, the goal is to come up with a representation and matching scheme that is robust to changes due to facial aging. Facial aging is a complex process that affects both the 3D shape of the face and its texture (e.g., wrinkles). These shape and texture changes degrade the performance of automatic face recognition systems. However, facial aging has not received substantial attention compared to other facial variations due to pose, lighting, and expression. We propose a 3D aging modeling technique and show how it can be used to compensate for the age variations to improve the face recognition performance. The aging modeling technique adapts view-invariant 3D face models to the given 2D face aging database.

However, the current distortion caused by harmonics in the grid voltage is difficult to be eliminated. Increasing the loop gain can reduce the current distortion, but this approach is compromised by the system stability requirement. Without increasing the loop gain, applying feedforward of the grid voltage can suppress the effect of grid voltage harmonics. This paper proposes the feedforward function of the grid voltage for the grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter. Specifically, the proposed feedforward function involves proportional, derivative, and second derivative of the grid voltage, and can be simplified according to the dominant harmonics in the grid voltage. The proposed feedforward scheme can effectively suppress the current distortion arising from the grid voltage harmonics, and the steady-state error of the injected current can be substantially reduced even if a conventional proportional and integral regulator is applied. A 6-kW experimental prototype has been tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed feedforward scheme.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2077312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580125","Damping resonance;dual-loop control;feedforward;LCL filter;total harmonic distortions (THD)","Power harmonic filters;Inverters;Harmonic analysis;Digital filters;Capacitors;Transfer functions;Regulators","","305","","23","IEEE","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This limits their application domain. Other approaches rely on training a machine learning algorithm. These methods however, are only as effective as the features used to train their learning machines. Towards ameliorating this we introduce the BLIINDS index (BLind Image Integrity Notator using DCT Statistics) which is a no-reference approach to image quality assessment that does not assume a specific type of distortion of the image. It is based on predicting image quality based on observing the statistics of local discrete cosine transform coefficients, and it requires only minimal training.

This approach to test automation, often coined “Search-based Software Testing” (SBST), has been used for a wide variety of test case generation purposes. Since SBST techniques are heuristic by nature, they must be empirically investigated in terms of how costly and effective they are at reaching their test objectives and whether they scale up to realistic development artifacts. However, approaches to empirically study SBST techniques have shown wide variation in the literature. This paper presents the results of a systematic, comprehensive review that aims at characterizing how empirical studies have been designed to investigate SBST cost-effectiveness and what empirical evidence is available in the literature regarding SBST cost-effectiveness and scalability. We also provide a framework that drives the data collection process of this systematic review and can be the starting point of guidelines on how SBST techniques can be empirically assessed. The intent is to aid future researchers doing empirical studies in SBST by providing an unbiased view of the body of empirical evidence and by guiding them in performing well-designed and executed empirical studies.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5210118","Evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms;frameworks;heuristics design;review and evaluation;test generation;testing strategies;validation.","System testing;Automatic testing;Software testing;Automation;Costs;Logic testing;Scalability;Guidelines;Genetic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","","304","","55","IEEE","21 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we combine existing tools for bottom-up image segmentation such as normalized cuts, with kernel methods commonly used in object recognition. These two sets of techniques are used within a discriminative clustering framework: the goal is to assign foreground/background labels jointly to all images, so that a supervised classifier trained with these labels leads to maximal separation of the two classes. In practice, we obtain a combinatorial optimization problem which is relaxed to a continuous convex optimization problem, that can itself be solved efficiently for up to dozens of images. We illustrate the proposed method on images with very similar foreground objects, as well as on more challenging problems with objects with higher intra-class variations.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539868","","Image segmentation;Computer vision;Kernel;Object recognition","","304","3","25","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only a few techniques have been reported for analyses of single-channel recordings. Examples are single-channel ICA (SCICA) and wavelet-ICA (WICA), which all have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new method for a single-channel signal decomposition. This method combines empirical-mode decomposition with ICA.

Electrodes are placed on the scalp to detect the microvolt-sized signals that result from synchronized neuronal activity within the brain. Current long-term EEG monitoring is generally either carried out as an inpatient in combination with video recording and long cables to an amplifier and recording unit or is ambulatory. In the latter, the EEG recorder is portable but bulky, and in principle, the subject can go about their normal daily life during the recording. In practice, however, this is rarely the case. It is quite common for people undergoing ambulatory EEG monitoring to take time off work and stay at home rather than be seen in public with such a device. Wearable EEG is envisioned as the evolution of ambulatory EEG units from the bulky, limited lifetime devices available today to small devices present only on the head that can record EEG for days, weeks, or months at a time [see Figure 1(a) and (b)]. Such miniaturized units could enable prolonged monitoring of chronic conditions such as epilepsy and greatly improve the end-user acceptance of BCI systems. In this article, we aim to provide a review and overview of wearable EEG technology, answering the questions: What is it, why is it needed, and what does it entail? We first investigate the requirements of portable EEG systems and then link these to the core applications of wearable EEG technology: epilepsy diagnosis, sleep disorder diagnosis, and BCIs. As a part of our review, we asked 21 neurologists (as a key user group) for their views on wearable EEG. This group highlighted that wearable EEG will be an essential future tool. Our descriptions here will focus mainly on epilepsyand the medical applications of wearable EEG, as this is the historical background of the EEG, our area of expertise, and a core motivating area in itself, but we will also discuss the other application areas. We continue by considering the forthcoming research challenges, principally new electrode technology and lower power electronics, and we outline our approach for dealing with the electronic power issues. We believe that the optimal approach to realizing wearable EEG technology is not to optimize any one part but to find the best set of tradeoffs at both the system and implementation level. In this article, we discuss two of these tradeoffs in detail: investigating the online compression of EEG data to reduce the system power consumption and the optimal method for providing this data compression.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2010.936545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463026","","Electroencephalography;Biomedical monitoring;Epilepsy;Video recording;Sleep;Brain computer interfaces;Electrodes;Scalp;Signal detection;Cables","Clothing;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Equipment Design;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemedicine;Telemedicine","302","1","58","IEEE","10 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A method of injecting the third and fifth harmonics into the input current to reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the output current is also proposed. While ensuring that the input power factor is higher than 0.9 to meet regulation standards such as ENERGY STAR, the proposed method allows the peak-to-average ratio of the output current to be reduced to 1.34 theoretically, which is beneficial for the safe operation of the LEDs. As an example, a flyback-based electrolytic capacitor-less LED driver is proposed, and its operation is analyzed. In order to inject the third and fifth harmonics into the input current, the function of the duty cycle in a half-line cycle is derived. It is then simplified to a fitting function, which can be easily implemented with the input voltage sensing.

Exact closed-form expressions of the outage probability of secondary transmissions, referred to as secondary outage probability, are derived under the constraint of satisfying a required outage probability of primary transmissions (primary outage probability) for both the traditional non-cooperation and the proposed adaptive cooperation schemes over Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical and simulation results show that, with a guaranteed primary outage probability, a floor of the secondary outage probability occurs in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Moreover, the outage probability floor of the adaptive cooperation scheme is lower than that of the non-cooperation scenario, which illustrates the advantage of the proposed scheme. In addition, we generalize the traditional definition of the diversity gain, which can not be applied directly in cognitive radio networks since mutual interference between the primary and secondary users should be considered. We derive the generalized diversity gain and show that, with a guaranteed primary outage probability, the full diversity order is achieved using the proposed adaptive cooperation scheme.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2053708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491132","Adaptive cooperation diversity;cognitive radio;diversity gain;outage probability;relay selection","Cognitive radio;Relays;Quality of service;Interference;Diversity methods;Fading;Throughput;Protocols;Permission;Signal processing","","301","","19","IEEE","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most DLAs presented earlier, for example ILS-DLA and K-SVD, update the dictionary after a batch of training vectors has been processed, usually using the whole set of training vectors as one batch. The training set is used iteratively to gradually improve the dictionary. The approach in RLS-DLA is a continuous update of the dictionary as each training vector is being processed. The core of the algorithm is compact and can be effectively implemented. The algorithm is derived very much along the same path as the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for adaptive filtering. Thus, as in RLS, a forgetting factor ¿ can be introduced and easily implemented in the algorithm. Adjusting ¿ in an appropriate way makes the algorithm less dependent on the initial dictionary and it improves both convergence properties of RLS-DLA as well as the representation ability of the resulting dictionary. Two sets of experiments are done to test different methods for learning dictionaries. The goal of the first set is to explore some basic properties of the algorithm in a simple setup, and for the second set it is the reconstruction of a true underlying dictionary.

In essence, CS enables the recovery of high-dimensional sparse signals from relatively few linear observations in the form of projections onto a collection of test vectors. Existing results show that if the entries of the test vectors are independent realizations of certain zero-mean random variables, then with high probability the unknown signals can be recovered by solving a tractable convex optimization. This work extends CS theory to settings where the entries of the test vectors exhibit structured statistical dependencies. It follows that CS can be effectively utilized in linear, time-invariant system identification problems provided the impulse response of the system is (approximately or exactly) sparse. An immediate application is in wireless multipath channel estimation. It is shown here that time-domain probing of a multipath channel with a random binary sequence, along with utilization of CS reconstruction techniques, can provide significant improvements in estimation accuracy compared to traditional least-squares based linear channel estimation strategies. Abstract extensions of the main results are also discussed, where the theory of equitable graph coloring is employed to establish the utility of CS in settings where the test vectors exhibit more general statistical dependencies.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2070191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605341","Circulant matrices;compressed sensing;Hankel matrices;restricted isometry property;sparse channel estimation;Toeplitz matrices;wireless communications","Channel estimation;Training;Sparse matrices;Estimation;Wireless communication;Random variables;Vectors","","300","","41","IEEE","18 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures built by microstrip technology is an attractive way to mitigate the mutual coupling problem.

The idea is to use the UC-EBG structures placed on top of the antenna layer. The main objective is to reduce both the element separation and the mutual coupling between the patch antennas, which in turn increases antenna directivity.

The steady state Kalman filter is used to perform state estimation while a failure detector is employed to detect anomalies in the system. An attacker wishes to compromise the integrity of the state estimator by hijacking a subset of sensors and sending altered readings. In order to inject fake sensor measurements without being detected the attacker will need to carefully design his actions to fool the estimator as abnormal sensor measurements would result in an alarm. It is important for a designer to determine the set of all the estimation biases that an attacker can inject into the system without being detected, providing a quantitative measure of the resilience of the system to such attacks. To this end, we will provide an ellipsoidal algorithm to compute its inner and outer approximations of such set.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290125","Canonical variate analysis (CVA);kernel density estimation (KDE);probability density function (PDF);process monitoring","Monitoring;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Page description languages;Fault diagnosis;Fault detection;Probability density function;Least squares approximation;Data analysis;Modeling","","296","","19","IEEE","20 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since radio link performance is approaching theoretical limits with 3G enhancements and LTE, the next performance leap in wireless networks will come from the network topology. LTE Advanced is about improving spectral efficiency per unit area. Using a mix of macro, pico, femto and relay base-stations, heterogeneous networks enable flexible and low-cost deployments and provide a uniform broadband experience to users anywhere in the network. This paper discusses the need for an alternative deployment model or topology using heterogeneous networks. To enhance the performance of these networks, advanced techniques are described which are needed to manage and control interference and deliver the full benefits of such networks. Range extension allows more user terminals to benefit directly from low-power base-stations such as picos, femtos, and relays. Adaptive inter-cell interference coordination provides smart resource allocation amongst interfering cells and improves inter-cell fairness in a heterogeneous network.

The method provides compensation for reactive, unbalanced, and harmonic load current components. A proportional-integral (PI) control law is derived through linearization of the inherently nonlinear SAPF system model, so that the tasks of current control dynamics and dc capacitor voltage dynamics become decoupled. This decoupling allows us to control the SAPF output currents and the dc bus voltage independently of each other, thereby providing either one of these decoupled subsystems a dynamic response that significantly slower than that of the other. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional method, a computational control delay compensation method, which delaylessly and accurately generates the SAPF reference currents, is proposed. The first step is to extract the SAPF reference currents from the sensed nonlinear load currents by applying the synchronous reference frame method, where a three-phase diode bridge rectifier with R-L load is taken as the nonlinear load, and then, the reference currents are modified, so that the delay will be compensated. The converter, which is controlled by the described control strategy, guarantees balanced overall supply currents, unity displacement power factor, and reduced harmonic load currents in the common coupling point. Various simulation and experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the nonlinear controller.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2038945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373908","Active power filter;control delay compensation;modeling;nonactive load current compensation;nonlinear control;power quality","Design for experiments;Active filters;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Delay;Power harmonic filters;Voltage control;Displacement control;Nonlinear control systems;Proportional control;Power system modeling","","294","","28","IEEE","8 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, our approach encodes the micro-structures of the face by a new learning-based encoding method. Unlike many previous manually designed encoding methods (e.g., LBP or SIFT), we use unsupervised learning techniques to learn an encoder from the training examples, which can automatically achieve very good tradeoff between discriminative power and invariance. Then we apply PCA to get a compact face descriptor. We find that a simple normalization mechanism after PCA can further improve the discriminative ability of the descriptor. The resulting face representation, learning-based (LE) descriptor, is compact, highly discriminative, and easy-to-extract. To handle the large pose variation in real-life scenarios, we propose a pose-adaptive matching method that uses pose-specific classifiers to deal with different pose combinations (e.g., frontal v.s. frontal, frontal v.s. left) of the matching face pair. Our approach is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods on the Labeled Face in Wild (LFW) benchmark (we achieved 84.45% recognition rate), while maintaining excellent compactness, simplicity, and generalization aability across different datasets.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539992","","Face recognition;Encoding;Histograms;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Face detection;Unsupervised learning;Design methodology;Asia;Lighting","","294","16","33","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current standard measures, such as the relative area of emphysema (RA), rely on a single intensity threshold on individual pixels, thus ignoring any interrelations between pixels. Texture analysis allows for a much richer representation that also takes the local structure around pixels into account. This paper presents a texture classification-based system for emphysema quantification in CT images. Measures of emphysema severity are obtained by fusing pixel posterior probabilities output by a classifier. Local binary patterns (LBP) are used as texture features, and joint LBP and intensity histograms are used for characterizing regions of interest (ROIs). Classification is then performed using a k nearest neighbor classifier with a histogram dissimilarity measure as distance. A 95.2% classification accuracy was achieved on a set of 168 manually annotated ROIs, comprising the three classes: normal tissue, centrilobular emphysema, and paraseptal emphysema. The measured emphysema severity was in good agreement with a pulmonary function test (PFT) achieving correlation coefficients of up to |r| = 0.79 in 39 subjects. The results were compared to RA and to a Gaussian filter bank, and the texture-based measures correlated significantly better with PFT than did RA.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2038575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5405641","Emphysema;local binary patterns (LBPs);quantitative computed tomography (CT);texture analysis;tissue classification","Pattern analysis;Computed tomography;Histograms;Lungs;Measurement standards;Area measurement;Current measurement;Image texture analysis;Performance evaluation;Nearest neighbor searches","Algorithms;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lung;Male;Normal Distribution;Pulmonary Emphysema;Pulmonary Emphysema;Respiratory Function Tests;Severity of Illness Index;Smoking;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","294","1","46","IEEE","2 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Abbott","School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, University of Adelaide, SA, Australia",Proceedings of the IEEE,"22 Dec 2009","2010","98","1","42","66","We take a fresh look at the major nonrenewable and renewable energy sources and examine their long-term viability, scalability, and the sustainability of the resources that they use. We achieve this by asking what would happen if each energy source was a single supply of power for the world, as a gedanken experiment. From this perspective, a solar hydrogen economy emerges as a dominant solution to the world's energy needs. If we globally tap sunlight over only 1% of the incident area at only an energy conversion efficiency of 1%, it is simple to show that this meets our current world energy consumption. As 9% of the planet surface area is taken up by desert and efficiencies well over 1% are possible, in practice, this opens up many exciting future opportunities. Specifically, we find solar thermal collection via parabolic reflectors - where focussed sunlight heats steam to about 600?C to drive a turbine - is the best available technology for generating electricity. For static power storage, to provide electricity at night, there are a number of viable options that are discussed. For mobile power storage, such as for fueling vehicles, we argue the case for both liquid and gaseous hydrogen for use in internal combustion engines. We outline a number of reasons why semiconductor solar cells and hydrogen fuel cells do not appear to scale up for a global solution. We adopt an approach that envisions exploiting massive economy of scale by establishing large arrays of solar collectors in hot desert regions of the world. For nonrenewable sources we argue that we cannot wait for them to be exhausted - we need to start conserving them imminently. What is often forgotten in the energy debate is that oil, natural gas, and coal are not only used as energy sources, but we also rely on them for embodying many crucial physical products. It is this fact that requires us to develop a solar hydrogen platform with urgency. It is argued that a solar future is unavoidable, as ultimately humankind has no other choice.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5357584","Consolidated utility time;economics of energy;electrolysis;energy;energy efficiency;energy generation;energy policy;energy supply;hydrogen;hydrogen liquefaction;hydrogen storage;hydrogen transfer;hydrogen transport;solar hydrogen economy;solar power;solar thermal;steam turbine;sustainability","Hydrogen;Renewable energy resources;Scalability;Power supplies;Energy conversion;Energy consumption;Planets;Solar heating;Turbines;Power generation","","294","1","116","IEEE","22 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The eigenanalysis is first carried out for each roof point of a building within its Voronoi neighborhood. Such analysis not only yields the surface normal for each lidar point but also separates the lidar points into planar and nonplanar ones. In the second step, the surface normals of all planar points are clustered with the fuzzy k-means method. To optimize this clustering process, a potential-based approach is used to estimate the number of clusters, while considering both geometry and topology for the cluster similarity. The final step of segmentation separates the parallel and coplanar segments based on their distances and connectivity, respectively. Building reconstruction starts with forming an adjacency matrix that represents the connectivity of the segmented planar segments. A roof interior vertex is determined by intersecting all planar segments that meet at one point, whereas constraints in the form of vertical walls or boundary are applied to determine the vertices on the building outline. Finally, an extended boundary regularization approach is developed based on multiple parallel and perpendicular line pairs to achieve topologically consistent and geometrically correct building models. This paper describes the detail principles and implementation steps for the aforementioned solution framework. Results of a number of buildings with diverse roof complexities are presented and evaluated.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2030180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5308335","Building extraction;clustering;LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar);reconstruction;segmentation","Laser radar;Clouds;Image edge detection;Data mining;Civil engineering;Image segmentation;Surface reconstruction;Geometry;Topology;Transmission line matrix methods","","292","5","40","IEEE","3 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target.

One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection.

New actions are synthesized by the application of statistical methods, where the goal and other characteristics of an action are utilized as queries to create a suitable control policy, taking into account the current state of the world. Nonlinear dynamic systems are employed as a motor representation.

Conventional converter protection via a sustained period of rotor-crowbar closed circuit leads to poor power output and sustained suppression of the stator voltages. A new minimum-threshold rotor-crowbar method is presented in this paper, improving fault response by reducing crowbar application periods to 11-16 ms, successfully diverting transient overcurrents, and restoring good power control within 45 ms of both fault initiation and clearance, thus enabling the DFIG to meet grid-code fault-ride-through requirements.

In this paper, the sixth harmonic of the integrator output of the synchronous d-axis proportional-integral (PI) current regulator is used to compensate the output voltage distortion due to the dead time effects, since the integrator output has ripple corresponding to six times the stator fundamental frequency. The proposed method can be easily implemented by feedforwardly adding compensation voltages to the output reference voltage of the synchronous PI current regulator. The proposed method, therefore, has some significant advantages such as simple implementation without additional hardware, easy mathematical computation, no offline experimental measurements, and application in both the steady state and the transient state. The validity of the proposed compensation algorithm is shown through several experiments.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2009.2031811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5308357","Dead time effects;integrator output of the synchronous $d-$axis proportional–integral (PI) current regulator;sixth harmonic;voltage distortion","Voltage;Pulse width modulation inverters;Harmonic distortion;Regulators;Pulse inverters;Phase distortion;Stators;Frequency;Hardware;Steady-state","","290","1","19","IEEE","3 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The memory scheduling algorithm should resolve memory contention by arbitrating memory access in such a way that competing threads progress at a relatively fast and even pace, resulting in high system throughput and fairness. Previously proposed memory scheduling algorithms are predominantly optimized for only one of these objectives: no scheduling algorithm provides the best system throughput and best fairness at the same time. This paper presents a new memory scheduling algorithm that addresses system throughput and fairness separately with the goal of achieving the best of both. The main idea is to divide threads into two separate clusters and employ different memory request scheduling policies in each cluster. Our proposal, Thread Cluster Memory scheduling (TCM), dynamically groups threads with similar memory access behavior into either the latency-sensitive (memory-non-intensive) or the bandwidth-sensitive (memory-intensive) cluster. TCM introduces three major ideas for prioritization: 1) we prioritize the latency-sensitive cluster over the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to improve system throughput, 2) we introduce a ``niceness'' metric that captures a thread's propensity to interfere with other threads, 3) we use niceness to periodically shuffle the priority order of the threads in the bandwidth-sensitive cluster to provide fair access to each thread in a way that reduces inter-thread interference. On the one hand, prioritizing memory-non-intensive threads significantly improves system throughput without degrading fairness, because such ``light'' threads only use a small fraction of the total available memory bandwidth. On the other hand, shuffling the priority order of memory-intensive threads improves fairness because it ensures no thread is disproportionately slowed down or starved. We evaluate TCM on a wide variety of multiprogrammed workloads and compare its performance to four previously proposed scheduling algorithms, finding that TCM achieves both the best system throughput and fairness. Averaged over 96 workloads on a 24-core system with 4 memory channels, TCM improves system throughput and reduces maximum slowdown by 4.6%/38.6% compared to ATLAS (previous work providing the best system throughput) and 7.6%/4.6% compared to PAR-BS (previous work providing the best fairness).","2379-3155","978-1-4244-9071-4","10.1109/MICRO.2010.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695526","memory scheduling;memory access behavior;fairness;system throughput;thread cluster;niceness","Instruction sets;Throughput;Scheduling algorithm;Clustering algorithms;Interference;Bandwidth","","290","7","28","IEEE","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this approach, the generative model of the captured signal is composed of a source process, which is assumed to be a Gaussian process with a time-varying variance, and an observation process modeled by a delayed linear prediction (DLP). The optimization objective for the dereverberation problem is derived to be the sum of the squared prediction errors normalized by the source variances; hence, this approach is referred to as variance-normalized delayed linear prediction (NDLP). Inheriting the characteristic of DLP, NDLP can robustly estimate an inverse system for late reverberation in the presence of noise without greatly distorting a direct speech signal. In addition, owing to the use of variance normalization, NDLP allows us to improve the dereverberation result especially with relatively short (of the order of a few seconds) observations. Furthermore, NDLP can be implemented in a computationally efficient manner in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison with two existing approaches.","1558-7924","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2052251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5547558","Dereverberation;inverse filtering;multichannel linear prediction;speech enhancement;statistical model-based signal processing","Speech;Reverberation;Predictive models;Speech processing;Optimization;Microphones;Correlation","","290","6","29","IEEE","12 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, the penalty in performance is huge. In this paper, we explore how design in the moderate inversion region helps to recover some of that lost performance, while staying quite close to the minimum-energy point. An energy-delay modeling framework that extends over the weak, moderate, and strong inversion regions is developed. The impact of activity and design parameters such as supply voltage and transistor sizing on the energy and performance in this operational region is derived. The quantitative benefits of operating in near-threshold region are established using some simple examples. The paper shows that a 20% increase in energy from the minimum-energy point gives back ten times in performance. Based on these observations, a pass-transistor based logic family that excels in this operational region is introduced. The logic family operates most of its logic in the above-threshold mode (using low-threshold transistors), yet containing leakage to only those in subthreshold. Operation below minimum-energy point of CMOS is demonstrated. In leakage-dominated ultralow-power designs, time-multiplexing will be shown to yield not only area, but also energy reduction due to lower leakage.

To deal with the data points sampled from a nonlinear manifold, for each data point, we construct a local clique comprising this data point and its neighboring data points. Inspired by the Fisher criterion, we use a local discriminant model for each local clique to evaluate the clustering performance of samples within the local clique. To obtain the clustering result, we further propose a unified objective function to globally integrate the local models of all the local cliques. With the unified objective function, spectral relaxation and spectral rotation are used to obtain the binary cluster indicator matrix for all the samples. We show that LDMGI shares a similar objective function with the spectral clustering (SC) algorithms, e.g., normalized cut (NCut). In contrast to NCut in which the Laplacian matrix is directly calculated based upon a Gaussian function, a new Laplacian matrix is learnt in LDMGI by exploiting both manifold structure and local discriminant information. We also prove that K-means and discriminative K-means (DisKmeans) are both special cases of LDMGI. Extensive experiments on several benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LDMGI. We observe in the experiments that LDMGI is more robust to algorithmic parameter, when compared with NCut. Thus, LDMGI is more appealing for the real image clustering applications in which the ground truth is generally not available for tuning algorithmic parameters.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2049235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454426","Clustering;K-means clustering;local discriminant model;spectral clustering","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Principal component analysis;Laplace equations;Indexing;Linear discriminant analysis;Educational institutions;Computer science;Manifolds;Robustness","","289","","40","IEEE","26 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, the USDA IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent between 23° N-50° N and 128° W-65° W. In particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2037163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353747","Agriculture;data assimilation;remote sensing;soil moisture","Soil moisture;Moisture;Data models;Remote sensing;Agriculture;Surface soil","","289","","29","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to effectively comment on the published experimental data, a ratio k has been proposed to compare the electric properties of the nanodielectrics with the matrix and assess the effect for nanoparticles doping. There is evidence that the short-term breakdown properties of nanodielectrics show a strong dependence on the applied voltage waveforms. The polarity and the cohesive energy density (CED) of polymer matrix have a dramatic influence on the properties of nanodielectrics. Nanoparticle doped composites show a positive effect on the long-term failure properties, such as ageing resistance and partial discharge (PD) properties of nanocomposites are superior than microcomposites and the matrix.

Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) has been shown as one of the best motion estimators. However, a significant drawback is its associated computational cost, especially when RF signals are used. In this paper, a method based on sum tables developed elsewhere is adapted for fast NCC calculation in ultrasound-based motion estimation, and is tested with respect to the speed enhancement of the specific application of ultrasound-based motion estimation. Both the numerator and denominator in the NCC definition are obtained through pre-calculated sum tables to eliminate redundancy of repeated NCC calculations. Unlike a previously reported method, a search region following the principle of motion estimation is applied in the construction of sum tables. Because an exhaustive search and high window overlap are typically used for highest quality imaging, the computational cost of the proposed method is significantly lower than that of the direct method using the NCC definition, without increasing bias and variance characteristics of the motion estimation or sacrificing the spatial resolution. Therefore, high quality, high spatial resolution, and high calculation speed can be all simultaneously obtained using the proposed methodology. The high efficiency of this method was verified using RF signals from a human abdominal aorta in vivo. For the parameters typically used, a real-time, very high frame rate of 310 frames/s was achieved for the motion estimation. The proposed method was also extended to 2-D NCC motion estimation and motion estimation with other algorithms. The technique could thus prove very useful and flexible for real-time motion estimation as well as in other fields such as optical flow and image registration.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480177","","Motion estimation;Ultrasonic imaging;Computational efficiency;Spatial resolution;Time domain analysis;Testing;High-resolution imaging;Optical imaging;Humans;Abdomen","Algorithms;Aorta, Abdominal;Computer Simulation;Echocardiography, Doppler;Elasticity Imaging Techniques;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Motion","288","8","54","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Implementation of several control methods has been presented in the past, with the goal of improving battery life and overall vehicle efficiency. It is clear that the control objectives vary with respect to vehicle velocity, power demand, and state of charge of both the batteries and UCs. Hence, an optimal control strategy design is the most critical aspect of an all-electric/plug-in hybrid electric vehicle operational characteristic. Although much effort has been made to improve the life of PHEV energy storage systems (ESSs), including research on energy storage device chemistries, this paper, on the contrary, highlights the fact that the fundamental problem lies within the design of power-electronics-based energy-management converters and the development of smarter control algorithms. This paper initially discusses battery and UC characteristics and then goes on to provide a detailed comparison of various proposed control strategies and proposes the use of precise power electronic converter topologies.

The Spherical Demons algorithm can also be modified to register a given spherical image to a probabilistic atlas. We demonstrate two variants of the algorithm corresponding to warping the atlas or warping the subject. Registration of a cortical surface mesh to an atlas mesh, both with more than 160 k nodes requires less than 5 min when warping the atlas and less than 3 min when warping the subject on a Xeon 3.2 GHz single processor machine. This is comparable to the fastest nondiffeomorphic landmark-free surface registration algorithms.

Safe and reliable operation of these critical infrastructure systems is a major concern in our society. In current state estimation algorithms there are bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect random outliers in the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy. Although such methods may detect a set of very basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of a more intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where deception attacks are performed, sending false information to the control center. Similar attacks have been studied before for linear state estimators, assuming the attacker has perfect model knowledge. Here we instead assume the attacker only possesses a perturbed model. Such a model may correspond to a partial model of the true system, or even an out-dated model. We characterize the attacker by a set of objectives, and propose policies to synthesize stealthy deceptions attacks, both in the case of linear and nonlinear estimators. We show that the more accurate model the attacker has access to, the larger deception attack he can perform undetected. Specifically, we quantify trade-offs between model accuracy and possible attack impact for different BDD schemes. The developed tools can be used to further strengthen and protect the critical state-estimation component in SCADA systems.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-7746-3","10.1109/CDC.2010.5717318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5717318","","Boolean functions;Data structures;Mathematical model;Equations;Measurement uncertainty;SCADA systems;Convergence","","287","1","18","IEEE","22 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These two features of multiplicative noise models preclude the direct application of most state-of-the-art algorithms, which are designed for solving unconstrained optimization problems where the objective has two terms: a quadratic data term (log-likelihood), reflecting the additive and Gaussian nature of the noise, plus a convex (possibly nonsmooth) regularizer (e.g., a total variation or wavelet-based regularizer/prior). In this paper, we address these difficulties by: (1) converting the multiplicative model into an additive one by taking logarithms, as proposed by some other authors; (2) using variable splitting to obtain an equivalent constrained problem; and (3) dealing with this optimization problem using the augmented Lagrangian framework.

No systematic studies have been conducted to understand how well these methods combat the class imbalance problem and which of these methods best manage the different challenges posed by imbalanced data sets. In particular, feature selection has rarely been studied outside of text classification problems. Additionally, no studies have looked at the additional problem of learning from small samples. This paper presents a first systematic comparison of the three types of methods developed for imbalanced data classification problems and of seven feature selection metrics evaluated on small sample data sets from different applications. We evaluated the performance of these metrics using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC). We compared each metric on the average performance across all problems and on the likelihood of a metric yielding the best performance on a specific problem. We examined the performance of these metrics inside each problem domain. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of these metrics to see which perform best across algorithms.

To address this limitation, the authors recently proposed a new algorithm, called RRT*, which ensures asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost sure convergence of the solution returned by the algorithm to an optimal solution, while maintaining the same properties of the standard RRT algorithm, both in terms of computation of feasible solutions, and of computational complexity. In this paper, the RRT* algorithm is extended to deal with differential constraints. A sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality is provided. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm equipped with any local steering procedure that satisfies this condition converges to an optimal solution almost surely.

In image approximations, our approximation scheme using the DST outperforms the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) while the computational cost of our scheme is comparable to the DWT.

Experimental result verifies that the proposed LDO is stable for a capacitive load from 0 to 50 pF (estimated equivalent parasitic capacitance from load circuits) and with load capability of 100 mA. Moreover, the gain-enhanced structure provides sufficient loop gain to improve line regulation to 3.78 mV/V and load regulation to 0.1 mV/mA, respectively. The embedded voltage-spike detection circuit enables pseudo Class-AB operation to drive the embedded power transistor promptly. The measured power consumption is only 6 $\mu$W under a 0.75-V supply.

For this scenario, an interesting question is whether the relay node should be deployed at all. That is, whether cooperation with an untrusted relay node can ever be beneficial. We first provide an achievable secrecy rate for the general untrusted relay channel, and proceed to investigate this question for two types of relay networks with orthogonal components. For the first model, there is an orthogonal link from the source to the relay. For the second model, there is an orthogonal link from the relay to the destination. For the first model, we find the equivocation capacity region and show that answer is negative. In contrast, for the second model, we find that the answer is positive. Specifically, we show, by means of the achievable secrecy rate based on compress-and-forward, that by asking the untrusted relay node to relay information, we can achieve a higher secrecy rate than just treating the relay as an eavesdropper. For a special class of the second model, where the relay is not interfering itself, we derive an upper bound for the secrecy rate using an argument whose net effect is to separate the eavesdropper from the relay. The merit of the new upper bound is demonstrated on two channels that belong to this special class. The Gaussian case of the second model mentioned above benefits from this approach in that the new upper bound improves the previously known bounds. For the Cover-Kim deterministic relay channel, the new upper bound finds the secrecy capacity when the source-destination link is not worse than the source-relay link, by matching with achievable rate we present.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2050958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508640","Information theoretic secrecy;Relay channel","Relays;Upper bound;Information theory;MIMO;Information security;Reliability theory;Application software;Communication networks;Signal processing","","285","","37","IEEE","12 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transformer eddy-current and proximity effects are analyzed, demonstrating that an extensive interleaving of primary and secondary windings is needed to avoid high winding losses. The analysis of transformer leakage inductance reveals that extremely low leakage inductance can be achieved, allowing stored energy to be dissipated. Power MOSFETs fully rated for repetitive avalanches allow primary-side voltage clamp circuits to be eliminated. The oversizing of the primary-switch voltage rating can thus be avoided, significantly reducing switch-conduction losses. Finally, silicon carbide rectifying diodes allow fast diode turn-off, further reducing losses. Detailed test results from a 1.5-kW full-bridge boost dc-dc converter verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate very high conversion efficiency.

This algorithm employs a hierarchical clustering method to locate and track multiple peaks. A fast local search method is also introduced to search optimal solutions in a promising subregion found by the clustering method. Experimental study is conducted based on the moving peaks benchmark to test the performance of the clustering PSO in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature.

It is believed that state estimators will also play an increasingly important role in future smart power grids, as a tool to optimally and more dynamically route power flows. Therefore security of the estimator becomes an important issue. The estimators are currently located in control centers, and large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted communication channels to the centers. We here study stealthy false-data attacks against these estimators. We define a security measure tailored to quantify how hard attacks are to perform, and describe an efficient algorithm to compute it. Since there are so many measurement devices in these systems, it is not reasonable to assume that all devices can be made encrypted overnight in the future. Therefore we propose two algorithms to place encrypted devices in the system such as to maximize their utility in terms of increased system security. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on two IEEE benchmark power networks under two attack and protection cost models.","","978-1-4244-6512-5","10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5622046","","Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Upper bound;Power systems;Cryptography;Indexes","","284","","10","IEEE","4 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an in-shoe plantar pressure measurement and analysis system based on a textile fabric sensor array, which is soft, light, and has a high-pressure sensitivity and a long service life. The sensors are connected with a soft polymeric board through conductive yarns and integrated into an insole. A stable data acquisition system interfaces with the insole, wirelessly transmits the acquired data to remote receiver through Bluetooth path. Three configuration modes are incorporated to gain connection with desktop, laptop, or smart phone, which can be configured to comfortably work in research laboratories, clinics, sport ground, and other outdoor environments.

These variable control limits, however, are difficult to realize in practice. In this paper, a linear Kalman filter based on a reduced order electrochemical model is designed to estimate internal battery potentials, concentration gradients, and state-of-charge (SOC) from external current and voltage measurements. A reference current governor predicts the operating margin with respect to electrode side reactions and surface depletion/saturation conditions responsible for damage and sudden loss of power. The estimates are compared with results from an experimentally validated, 1-D, nonlinear finite volume model of a 6 Ah hybrid electric vehicle battery. The linear filter provides, to within ~ 2%, performance in the 30%-70% SOC range except in the case of severe current pulses that draw electrode surface concentrations to near saturation and depletion, although the estimates recover as concentration gradients relax. With 4 to 7 states, the filter has low-order comparable to empirical equivalent circuit models commonly employed and described in the literature. Accurate estimation of the battery's internal electrochemical state enables an expanded range of pulse operation.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2009.2027023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256311","Electrochemical model;lithium ion battery;model reduction;reference governor;state-of-charge (SOC) estimation","Battery management systems;Lithium;State estimation;Electrodes;Hybrid electric vehicles;Voltage measurement;Nonlinear filters;Equivalent circuits;Predictive models;Educational technology","","282","1","23","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing altimeter measurements are not adequate to characterize the dynamic variations of most inland water bodies, nor of ocean eddies at scales of less than about 100 km, notwithstanding that such eddies play a key role in ocean circulation and climate change. For terrestrial hydrology, in situ and spaceborne measurements of water surface elevation form the basis for estimates of water storage change in lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands, and of river discharge. However, storage in most inland water bodies, e.g., millions of Arctic lakes, is not readily measured using existing technologies. A solution to the needs of both surface water hydrology and physical oceanography communities is the measurement of water elevations along rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands and over the ocean surface using swath altimetry. The proposed surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) mission will make such measurements. The core technology for SWOT is the Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIN), which would achieve spatial resolution on the order of tens of meters and centimetric vertical precision when averaged over targets of interest. Average revisit times will depend upon latitude, with two to four revisits at low to mid latitudes and up to ten revisits at high latitudes per $\sim$20-day orbit repeat period.

In this paper we present an algorithm for removing the effects of light scattering, referred to as dehazing, in underwater images. Our key contribution is to propose a simple, yet effective, prior that exploits the strong difference in attenuation between the three image color channels in water to estimate the depth of the scene. We then use this estimate to reduce the spatially varying effect of haze in the image. Our method works with a single image and does not require any specialized hardware or prior knowledge of the scene. As a by-product of the dehazing process, an up-to-scale depth map of the scene is produced.

For inversed synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), the image of a target is usually constructed by strong scattering centers whose number is much smaller than that of pixels of an image plane. This sparsity of the ISAR signal intrinsically paves a way to apply CS to the reconstruction of high-resolution ISAR imagery. CS-based high-resolution ISAR imaging with limited pulses is developed, and it performs well in the case of high signal-to-noise ratios. However, strong noise and clutter are usually inevitable in radar imaging, which challenges current high-resolution imaging approaches based on parametric modeling, including the CS-based approach. In this paper, we present an improved version of CS-based high-resolution imaging to overcome strong noise and clutter by combining coherent projectors and weighting with the CS optimization for ISAR image generation. Real data are used to test the robustness of the improved CS imaging compared with other current techniques. Experimental results show that the approach is capable of precise estimation of scattering centers and effective suppression of noise.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2048575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482210","Compressing sampling;compressive sensing;inversed synthetic aperture radar (ISAR);radar imaging;superresolution","Image resolution;Radar polarimetry;High-resolution imaging;Image coding;Radar scattering;Clutter;Signal resolution;Image sampling;Pixel;Image reconstruction","","280","","40","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two approaches were developed to achieve high electric energy density: explore high dielectric constant (K) materials and improve high operation electric field. Relaxor ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based copolymers P(VDF-HFP), P(VDF-CTFE) and terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) have been proven to possess high electric energy density. An energy density of over 25 J/cm3 has been achieved in PVDF-based polymers, which represents the state of art in high energy density polymers. Aromatic polyurea thin films were developed through vapor phase deposition, exhibiting relatively high dielectric constant, low loss, high breakdown field (>800 MV/m) and consequently high energy density (>12 J/cm3).

The dynamic model of the system with Bouc-Wen hysteresis is established and identified through particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach, and the controller is designed based on Lyapunov stability analysis. A high-gain observer is adopted to estimate the full state from the only measurable position information. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of proposed controller is superior to that of conventional SMCPE in both set-point regulation and motion tracking control.

In previous work, we designed a framework called PowerPack that was the first tool to isolate the power consumption of devices including disks, memory, NICs, and processors in a high-performance cluster and correlate these measurements to application functions. In this work, we extend our framework to support systems with multicore, multiprocessor-based nodes, and then provide in-depth analyses of the energy consumption of parallel applications on clusters of these systems.

However, if the salient regions comprise more than half the pixels of the image, or if the background is complex, the background gets highlighted instead of the salient object.

The objective is to maximize the system transmission rate subject to individual power constraints on each node or a total network power constraint. We formulate such a problem as a subcarrier-pair based resource allocation that seeks the joint optimization of subcarrier pairing, subcarrier-pair-to-relay assignment, and power allocation. Using a dual approach, we solve this problem efficiently in an asymptotically optimal manner. Specifically, for the optimization problem with individual power constraints, the computational complexity is polynomial in the number of subcarriers and relay nodes, whereas the complexity of the problem with a total power constraint is polynomial in the number of subcarriers.We further propose two suboptimal algorithms for the former to trade off performance for complexity. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the average transmission rate and outage probability of the proposed algorithms.

In particular, we consider a scenario where keywords are associated with the training images, e.g. as found on photo sharing websites. The goal is to learn a classifier for images alone, but we will use the keywords associated with labeled and unlabeled images to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning. We first learn a strong Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) classifier using both the image content and keywords, and use it to score unlabeled images. We then learn classifiers on visual features only, either support vector machines (SVM) or least-squares regression (LSR), from the MKL output values on both the labeled and unlabeled images. In our experiments on 20 classes from the PASCAL VOC'07 set and 38 from the MIR Flickr set, we demonstrate the benefit of our semi-supervised approach over only using the labeled images.

In the proposed control strategy, the system can run in two different modes depending on the power requirement in the microgrid. In mode-1, specified amount of real and reactive power are shared between the utility and the microgrid through the back-to-back converters. Mode-2 is invoked when the power that can be supplied by the distributed generators (DGs) in the microgrid reaches its maximum limit. In such a case, the rest of the power demand of the microgrid has to be supplied by the utility. An arrangement between DGs in the microgrid is proposed to achieve load sharing in both grid connected and islanded modes. The back-to-back converters also provide total frequency isolation between the utility and the microgrid. It is shown that the voltage or frequency fluctuation in the utility side has no impact on voltage or power in microgrid side. Proper relay-breaker operation coordination is proposed during fault along with the blocking of the back-to-back converters for seamless resynchronization. Both impedance and motor type loads are considered to verify the system stability. The impact of dc side voltage fluctuation of the DGs and DG tripping on power sharing is also investigated.

Besides outliers induced in the process and observation noises, we consider in this paper a new type called structural outliers. For a filter to be able to counter the effect of these outliers, observation redundancy in the system is necessary. We have therefore developed a robust filter in a batch-mode regression form to process the observations and predictions together, making it very effective in suppressing multiple outliers. A key step in this filter is a new prewhitening method that incorporates a robust multivariate estimator of location and covariance. The other main step is the use of a generalized maximum likelihood-type (GM) estimator based on Schweppe's proposal and the Huber function, which has a high statistical efficiency at the Gaussian distribution and a positive breakdown point in regression. The latter is defined as the largest fraction of contamination for which the estimator yields a finite maximum bias under contamination. This GM-estimator enables our filter to bound the influence of residual and position, where the former measures the effects of observation and innovation outliers and the latter assesses that of structural outliers. The estimator is solved via the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, in which the residuals are standardized utilizing robust weights and scale estimates. Finally, the state estimation error covariance matrix of the proposed GM-Kalman filter is derived from its influence function. Simulation results revealed that our filter compares favorably with the H¿-filter in the presence of outliers.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2039731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371933","Impulsive noise;Kalman filter;non-Gaussian filter;outliers;prewhitening;robust statistics","Filters;Noise robustness;Noise generators;Contamination;Linear systems;Counting circuits;Redundancy;Proposals;Gaussian distribution;Electric breakdown","","275","","61","IEEE","31 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we introduce block-based Fisher's linear discriminant (BFLD) to reduce the dimensionality of the proposed descriptor and at the same time enhance its discriminative power.

In vehicular applications, cognitive radios typically transit regions with differing densities of primary users. Therefore, speed of detection is key, and so, detection based on a small number of samples is particularly advantageous for vehicular applications. Assuming no prior knowledge of the primary user's signaling scheme, the channels between the primary user and the cognitive user, and the variance of the noise seen at the cognitive user, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed to detect the presence/absence of the primary user.

In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Colour Correction Method (UCM) for underwater image enhancement. UCM is based on colour balancing, contrast correction of RGB colour model and contrast correction of HSI colour model. Firstly, the colour cast is reduced by equalizing the colour values. Secondly, an enhancement to a contrast correction method is applied to increase the Red colour by stretching red histogram towards the maximum (i.e., right side), similarly the Blue colour is reduced by stretching the blue histogram towards the minimum (i.e., left side). Thirdly, the Saturation and Intensity components of the HSI colour model have been applied for contrast correction to increase the true colour using Saturation and to address the illumination problem through Intensity. We compare our results with three well known methods, namely Gray World, White Patch and Histogram Equalisation using Adobe Photoshop.

User participation is the most important element in participatory sensing applications for providing adequate level of service quality. However, incentive mechanism and its economic model for user participation have never been addressed so far in this research domain. In order to stimulate user participation, we design and evaluate a novel Reverse Auction based Dynamic Price (RADP) incentive mechanism, where users can sell their sensing data to a service provider with users' claimed bid prices. The proposed incentive mechanism focuses on minimizing and stabilizing incentive cost while maintaining adequate number of participants by preventing users from dropping out of participatory sensing applications. Compared with a Random Selection with Fixed Price (RSFP) incentive mechanism, the proposed mechanism not only reduces the incentive cost for retaining same number of participants by more than 60% but also improves the fairness of incentive distribution and social welfare. More importantly, RADP can remove burden of accurate pricing for user sensing data, the most difficult step in RSFP.","","978-1-4244-5328-3","10.1109/PERCOM.2010.5466993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466993","component;Participatory Sensing;Economic Model;Incentive;Reverse Auction","Cost accounting;Pricing;Smart phones;Milling machines;Power generation economics;Data privacy;Investments;Intelligent sensors;Environmental economics;Incentive schemes","","273","1","21","IEEE","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These techniques are widely used for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI of moving subjects and organs. Although high-quality slices are frequently acquired by these techniques, inter-slice motion leads to severe motion artifacts that are apparent in out-of-plane views. Slice sequential acquisitions do not enable 3-D volume representation. In this study, we have developed a novel technique based on a slice acquisition model, which enables the reconstruction of a volumetric image from multiple-scan slice acquisitions. The super-resolution volume reconstruction is formulated as an inverse problem of finding the underlying structure generating the acquired slices. We have developed a robust M-estimation solution which minimizes a robust error norm function between the model-generated slices and the acquired slices. The accuracy and robustness of this novel technique has been quantitatively assessed through simulations with digital brain phantom images as well as high-resolution newborn images.

It harnesses the spatial diversity of a multi-relay network and addresses the vexing problem of a relay's batteries getting drained in forwarding information to the destination. We consider a cooperative system in which EH nodes volunteer to serve as amplify-and-forward relays whenever they have sufficient energy for transmission. For a general class of stationary and ergodic EH processes, we introduce the notion of energy constrained and energy unconstrained relays and analytically characterize the symbol error rate of the system. Further insight is gained by an asymptotic analysis that considers the cases where the signal-to-noise-ratio or the number of relays is large. Our analysis quantifies how the energy usage at an EH relay and, consequently, its availability for relaying, depends not only on the relay's energy harvesting process, but also on its transmit power setting and the other relays in the system. The optimal static transmit power setting at the EH relays is also determined. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a system that uses EH relays differs in significant ways from one that uses conventional cooperative relays.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2010.091510.100447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585638","Energy harvesting;relays;selection;cooperative systems;diversity methods;modulation;fading channels;amplify-and-forward;energy storage;wireless sensor networks","Relays;Energy harvesting;Batteries;Wireless sensor networks;Signal to noise ratio;Gain;Approximation methods","","272","2","34","IEEE","27 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional condition monitoring techniques, such as vibration, lubrication oil, and generator current signal analysis, require the deployment of a variety of sensors and computationally intensive analysis techniques. This paper describes a WT condition monitoring technique that uses the generator output power and rotational speed to derive a fault detection signal. The detection algorithm uses a continuous-wavelet-transform-based adaptive filter to track the energy in the prescribed time-varying fault-related frequency bands in the power signal. The central frequency of the filter is controlled by the generator speed, and the filter bandwidth is adapted to the speed fluctuation. Using this technique, fault features can be extracted, with low calculation times, from direct- or indirect-drive fixed- or variable-speed WTs. The proposed technique has been validated experimentally on a WT drive train test rig. A synchronous or induction generator was successively installed on the test rig, and both mechanical and electrical fault like perturbations were successfully detected when applied to the test rig.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2032202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256318","Adaptive signal processing;condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;induction generators;signal processing;synchronous generators;time–frequency analysis;wavelet transforms;wind power generation","Condition monitoring;Wind turbines;Testing;Signal generators;Signal analysis;Power generation;Frequency;Filters;Induction generators;Vibrations","","272","3","18","IEEE","22 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using some new approaches and techniques, several novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability of the trivial solution in the mean square. The results presented in this paper generalize and improve many known results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2054108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510187","Continuously distributed delay;impulsive perturbation;Markovian jump parameter;robust exponential stability;stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural network (CGNN);unknown parameter","Robust stability;Stochastic processes;Neural networks;Delay effects;Hopfield neural networks;Recurrent neural networks;Cellular neural networks;Mathematics;Switches;Sufficient conditions","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Markov Chains;Neural Networks (Computer);Stochastic Processes;Time Factors","270","","41","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The essence of the subspace-based optimization method is that part of the contrast source is determined from the spectrum analysis without using any optimization, whereas the rest is determined by optimization method. This feature significantly speeds up the convergence of the algorithm. There is a great flexibility in partitioning the space of induced current into two orthogonal complementary subspaces: the signal subspace and the noise subspace. This flexibility enables the algorithm to perform robustly against noise.

Hyperspectral imaging provides more detailed spectral and spatial information on the land cover than other remote sensing resources. Over the past ten years, traditional and formerly widely accepted statistical classification methods have been superseded by more recent machine learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machines (SVMs), or by multiple classifier systems (MCS). This can be explained by limitations of statistical approaches with regard to high-dimensional data, multimodal classes, and often limited availability of training data. In the presented study, MCSs based on SVM and random feature selection (RFS) are applied to explore the potential of a synergetic use of the two concepts. We investigated how the number of selected features and the size of the MCS influence classification accuracy using two hyperspectral data sets, from different environmental settings. In addition, experiments were conducted with a varying number of training samples. Accuracies are compared with regular SVM and random forests. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the generation of an SVM-based classifier system with RFS significantly improves overall classification accuracy as well as producer's and user's accuracies. In addition, the ensemble strategy results in smoother, i.e., more realistic, classification maps than those from stand-alone SVM. Findings from the experiments were successfully transferred onto an additional hyperspectral data set.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2041784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439692","Classifier ensembles;hyperspectral data;multiple classifier systems (MCSs);random feature selection (RFS);support vector machines (SVMs)","Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Hyperspectral sensors;Hyperspectral imaging;Machine learning algorithms;Training data;Infrared sensors;Kernel;Classification algorithms;Remote sensing","","267","","44","IEEE","29 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prediction intervals complement the more common wind power point forecasts, by giving a range of potential outcomes for a given probability, their so-called nominal coverage rate. Ideally they inform of the situation-specific uncertainty of point forecasts. In order to avoid a restrictive assumption on the shape of forecast error distributions, focus is given to an empirical and nonparametric approach named adapted resampling. This approach employs a fuzzy inference model that permits to integrate expertise on the characteristics of prediction errors for providing conditional interval forecasts. By simultaneously generating prediction intervals with various nominal coverage rates, one obtains full predictive distributions of wind generation. Adapted resampling is applied here to the case of an onshore Danish wind farm, for which three point forecasting methods are considered as input. The probabilistic forecasts generated are evaluated based on their reliability and sharpness, while compared to forecasts based on quantile regression and the climatology benchmark.

In a long-term context, planners must adopt a probabilistic view of potential peak demand levels. Therefore density forecasts (providing estimates of the full probability distributions of the possible future values of the demand) are more helpful than point forecasts, and are necessary for utilities to evaluate and hedge the financial risk accrued by demand variability and forecasting uncertainty. This paper proposes a new methodology to forecast the density of long-term peak electricity demand. Peak electricity demand in a given season is subject to a range of uncertainties, including underlying population growth, changing technology, economic conditions, prevailing weather conditions (and the timing of those conditions), as well as the general randomness inherent in individual usage. It is also subject to some known calendar effects due to the time of day, day of week, time of year, and public holidays. A comprehensive forecasting solution is described in this paper. First, semi-parametric additive models are used to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables, including temperatures, calendar effects and some demographic and economic variables. Then the demand distributions are forecasted by using a mixture of temperature simulation, assumed future economic scenarios, and residual bootstrapping. The temperature simulation is implemented through a new seasonal bootstrapping method with variable blocks. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the probability distribution of annual and weekly peak electricity demand for South Australia since 2007. The performance of the methodology is evaluated by comparing the forecast results with the actual demand of the summer 2007-2008.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2036017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345698","Density forecast;long-term demand forecasting;simulation;time series","Economic forecasting;Weather forecasting;Demand forecasting;Probability distribution;Uncertainty;Calendars;Temperature;Power generation;Timing;Demography","","265","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method selected a less number of genes compared to MRMR or SVM-RFE on most datasets.

Despite considerable progress on stability and stabilization of switched systems, the constant evolution of technology demands that we make similar progress with respect to different, and perhaps more complex, objectives. This paper describes one particular approach to address these different objectives based on the construction of approximately equivalent (bisimilar) symbolic models for switched systems. The main contribution of this paper consists in showing that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental stability of a switched system (i.e., existence of a common Lyapunov function, or multiple Lyapunov functions with dwell time), it is possible to construct a finite symbolic model that is approximately bisimilar to the original switched system with a precision that can be chosen a priori. To support the computational merits of the proposed approach, we use symbolic models to synthesize controllers for two examples of switched systems, including the boost dc-dc converter.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2009.2034922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342460","Approximate bisimulation;finite controllers;switched systems","Switched systems;Control system synthesis;Stability;Lyapunov method;Systems engineering and theory;Software systems;Switching converters;Control systems;Signal synthesis;Engineering profession","","264","1","22","IEEE","1 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most commonly used intensity-based similarity measures rely on the assumptions of independence and stationarity of the intensities from pixel to pixel. Such measures cannot capture the complex interactions among the pixel intensities, and often result in less satisfactory registration performances, especially in the presence of spatially-varying intensity distortions. We propose a novel similarity measure that accounts for intensity nonstationarities and complex spatially-varying intensity distortions in mono-modal settings. We derive the similarity measure by analytically solving for the intensity correction field and its adaptive regularization. The final measure can be interpreted as one that favors a registration with minimum compression complexity of the residual image between the two registered images. One of the key advantages of the new similarity measure is its simplicity in terms of both computational complexity and implementation. This measure produces accurate registration results on both artificial and real-world problems that we have tested, and outperforms other state-of-the-art similarity measures in these cases.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2053043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487419","Bias field;image registration;nonstationary intensity distortion;residual complexity;sparseness","Image registration;Distortion measurement;Biomedical measurements;Pixel;Biological materials;Biomedical materials;Permission;Performance evaluation;Image coding;Computational complexity","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","264","3","31","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transmitters and receivers are nodes of a small scale wireless network and are assumed to be randomly scattered on a disk. The transmit nodes transmit uncorrelated waveforms. Each receive node applies compressive sampling to the received signal to obtain a small number of samples, which the node subsequently forwards to a fusion center. Assuming that the targets are sparsely located in the angle-Doppler space, based on the samples forwarded by the receive nodes the fusion center formulates an l 1 -optimization problem, the solution of which yields target angle and Doppler information. The proposed approach achieves the superior resolution of MIMO radar with far fewer samples than required by other approaches. This implies power savings during the communication phase between the receive nodes and the fusion center. Performance in the presence of a jammer is analyzed for the case of slowly moving targets. Issues related to forming the basis matrix that spans the angle-Doppler space, and for selecting a grid for that space are discussed.

Server virtualization provides a technical means for server consolidation. Thus, multiple virtual servers can be hosted on a single server. Server consolidation describes the process of combining the workloads of several different servers on a set of target servers. We focus on server consolidation with dozens or hundreds of servers, which can be regularly found in enterprise data centers. Cost saving is among the key drivers for such projects. This paper presents decision models to optimally allocate source servers to physical target servers while considering real-world constraints. Our central model is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Therefore, besides an exact solution method, a heuristic is presented to address large-scale server consolidation projects. In addition, a preprocessing method for server load data is introduced allowing for the consideration of quality-of-service levels. Extensive experiments were conducted based on a large set of server load data from a data center provider focusing on managerial concerns over what types of problems can be solved. Results show that, on average, server savings of 31 percent can be achieved only by taking cycles in the server workload into account.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467027","Management of services delivery;modeling of resources;data center management services;optimization of services systems.","Modeling;Resource management;Management;Computational modeling;Operating systems;Data models","","262","6","38","IEEE","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We aim to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in the mean square sense. First, by introducing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that accounts for the mode-dependent mixed delays, stochastic analysis is conducted in order to derive a criterion for the exponential stabilizability problem. Then, a variation of such a criterion is developed to facilitate the controller design by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach.

Microgrids consist of multiple distributed generators (DGs) that are usually integrated via power electronic inverters. In order to enhance power quality and power distribution reliability, microgrids need to operate in both grid-connected and island modes. Consequently, microgrids can suffer performance degradation as the operating conditions vary due to abrupt mode changes and variations in bus voltages and system frequency. This paper presents controller design and optimization methods to stably coordinate multiple inverter-interfaced DGs and to robustly control individual interface inverters against voltage and frequency disturbances. Droop-control concepts are used as system-level multiple DG coordination controllers, and control theory is applied to device-level inverter controllers. Optimal control parameters are obtained by particle-swarm-optimization algorithms, and the control performance is verified via simulation studies.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2010.2044970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437183","Control-parameter tuning;distributed generator (DG);droop controller;${\rm L}_{1}$ theory;microgrid;optimal control;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Control systems;Inverters;Distributed power generation;Frequency;Voltage control;Optimal control;Renewable energy resources;Energy management;Power generation;Power electronics","","261","3","24","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are M distributed players competing for N independent arms. Each arm, when played, offers i.i.d. reward according to a distribution with an unknown parameter. At each time, each player chooses one arm to play without exchanging observations or any information with other players. Players choosing the same arm collide, and, depending on the collision model, either no one receives reward or the colliding players share the reward in an arbitrary way. We show that the minimum system regret of the decentralized MAB grows with time at the same logarithmic order as in the centralized counterpart where players act collectively as a single entity by exchanging observations and making decisions jointly. A decentralized policy is constructed to achieve this optimal order while ensuring fairness among players and without assuming any pre-agreement or information exchange among players. Based on a time-division fair sharing (TDFS) of the M best arms, the proposed policy is constructed and its order optimality is proven under a general reward model. Furthermore, the basic structure of the TDFS policy can be used with any order-optimal single-player policy to achieve order optimality in the decentralized setting. We also establish a lower bound on the system regret for a general class of decentralized polices, to which the proposed policy belongs.

In this paper, we focus on addressing the routing issue in UWSNs. We propose an adaptive, energy-efficient, and lifetime-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning, QELAR. Our protocol assumes generic MAC protocols and aims at prolonging the lifetime of networks by making residual energy of sensor nodes more evenly distributed. The residual energy of each node as well as the energy distribution among a group of nodes is factored in throughout the routing process to calculate the reward function, which aids in selecting the adequate forwarders for packets. We have performed extensive simulations of the proposed protocol on the Aqua-sim platform and compared with one existing routing protocol (VBF) in terms of packet delivery rate, energy efficiency, latency, and lifetime. The results show that QELAR yields 20 percent longer lifetime on average than VBF.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2010.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5408367","Routing protocols;distributed networks;wireless communication;mobile communication systems.","Routing protocols;Energy efficiency;Acoustic sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Media Access Protocol;Monitoring;Delay;Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Underwater acoustics","","260","1","29","IEEE","8 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this two-part paper, we determine the fundamental limits of localization accuracy of wideband wireless networks in harsh multipath environments. We first develop a general framework to characterize the localization accuracy of a given node here and then extend our analysis to cooperative location-aware networks in Part II. In this paper, we characterize localization accuracy in terms of a performance measure called the squared position error bound (SPEB), and introduce the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to derive the SPEB in a succinct expression. This methodology provides insights into the essence of the localization problem by unifying localization information from individual anchors and that from a priori knowledge of the agent's position in a canonical form. Our analysis begins with the received waveforms themselves rather than utilizing only the signal metrics extracted from these waveforms, such as time-of-arrival and received signal strength. Hence, our framework exploits all the information inherent in the received waveforms, and the resulting SPEB serves as a fundamental limit of localization accuracy.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2060110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571900","Cramér–Rao bound (CRB);equivalent Fisher information (EFI);information inequality;localization;ranging information (RI);squared position error bound (SPEB)","Accuracy;Wideband;Antenna arrays;Arrays;Antenna measurements;Linear matrix inequalities","","259","4","72","IEEE","13 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stator and rotor pole arc angles are selected as the optimized variables. Furthermore, the authors also discuss the design requirements and some constraints on the optimization design. The results of the optimization design show that the proposed method meets the requirements of EVs on electric motors well. A prototype of the optimally designed in-wheel SRM for EVs has been manufactured. This paper provides a valuable method to implement the optimal design of SRMs for EVs.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2010.2051390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5545589","Design;electric vehicles;in-wheel;optimization;switched reluctance motors (SRMs)","Design optimization;Reluctance motors;Electric vehicles;Torque;Reluctance machines;Electric motors;Copper;Lamination;Stators;Rotors","","258","1","17","IEEE","9 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emerging new features of mobile devices give opportunity to new threats. Android is one of the newer operating systems targeting smartphones. While being based on a Linux kernel, Android has unique properties and specific limitations due to its mobile nature. This makes it harder to detect and react upon malware attacks if using conventional techniques. In this paper, we propose an Android Application Sandbox (AASandbox) which is able to perform both static and dynamic analysis on Android programs to automatically detect suspicious applications. Static analysis scans the software for malicious patterns without installing it. Dynamic analysis executes the application in a fully isolated environment, i.e. sandbox, which intervenes and logs low-level interactions with the system for further analysis. Both the sandbox and the detection algorithms can be deployed in the cloud, providing a fast and distributed detection of suspicious software in a mobile software store akin to Google's Android Market. Additionally, AASandbox might be used to improve the efficiency of classical anti-virus applications available for the Android operating system.","","978-1-4244-9356-2","10.1109/MALWARE.2010.5665792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665792","","Malware;Smart phones;Kernel;Mobile communication","","258","30","35","IEEE","13 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the common-mode voltage model, modulation techniques are proposed to eliminate the leakage current in transformerless PV systems without requiring any modification on the converter and any additional hardware. The main drawback is that the proposed modulation technique for two-level inverters can only be used with 650-V dc link in the case of a 110-V (rms) grid phase voltage. Comparisons among the modulation techniques are discussed, and it is proven that the proposed modulation for two- and three-level inverters presents the best results.

Specifically, in case of natural calamities or disasters, decision makers can now easily use an old archived optical with a newly acquired (postdisaster) SAR image. Although the latest satellites provide the end user already georeferenced and orthorectified data products, still, registration differences exist between different data sets. These differences need to be taken care of through quick automated registration techniques before using the images in different applications. Specifically, mutual information (MI) has been utilized for the intricate SAR-optical registration problem. The computation of this metric involves estimating the joint histogram directly from image intensity values, which might have been generated from different sensor geometries and/or modalities (e.g., SAR and optical). Satellites carrying high-resolution remote sensing sensors like TerraSAR-X and Ikonos generate enormous data volume along with fine Earth observation details that might lead to failure of MI to detect correct registration parameters. In this paper, a solely histogram-based method to achieve automatic registration within TerraSAR-X and Ikonos images acquired specifically over urban areas is analyzed. Taking future sensors into a perspective, techniques like compression and segmentation for handling the enormous data volume and incompatible radiometry generated due to different SAR-optical image acquisition characteristics have been rightfully analyzed. The findings indicate that the proposed method is successful in estimating large global shifts followed by a fine refinement of registration parameters for high-resolution images acquired over dense urban areas.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2034842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340570","High resolution;image matching;remote sensing","Urban areas;Optical sensors;Satellite broadcasting;Adaptive optics;Remote sensing;Image sensors;Image analysis;Synthetic aperture radar;Laser radar;Mutual information","","257","1","26","IEEE","24 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The coupling is performed by a term in the acceptance probability function, which is a function of the energies of the current states of all SA processes. A particular CSA instance method is distinguished by the form of its coupling term and acceptance probability. In this paper, we present three CSA instance methods and compare them with the uncoupled case, i.e., multistart SA. The primary objective of the coupling in CSA is to create cooperative behavior via information exchange. This aim helps in the decision of whether uphill moves will be accepted. In addition, coupling can provide information that can be used online to steer the overall optimization process toward the global optimum. We present an example where we use the acceptance temperature to control the variance of the acceptance probabilities with a simple control scheme. This approach leads to much better optimization efficiency, because it reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm to initialization parameters while guiding the optimization process to quasioptimal runs.

In this paper, we investigate several Cloud Computing system providers about their concerns on security and privacy issues. We find those concerns are not adequate and more should be added in terms of five aspects (i.e., availability, confidentiality, data integrity, control, audit) for security. Moreover, released acts on privacy are out of date to protect users' private information in the new environment (i.e., Cloud Computing system environment) since they are no longer applicable to the new relationship between users and providers, which contains three parties (i.e., Cloud service user, Cloud service provider/Cloud user, Cloud provider). Multi located data storage and services (i.e., applications) in the Cloud make privacy issues even worse. Hence, adapting released acts for new scenarios in the Cloud, it will result in more users to step into Cloud.

In practice, usually the choice of such parameters is made empirically with trial and error if no “ground-truth” reference is available. Some analytical methods such as cross-validation and Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) have been successfully used to set such parameters. However, these methods tend to be strongly reliant on restrictive assumptions on the noise, and also computationally heavy. In this paper, we propose a no-reference metric Q which is based upon singular value decomposition of local image gradient matrix, and provides a quantitative measure of true image content (i.e., sharpness and contrast as manifested in visually salient geometric features such as edges,) in the presence of noise and other disturbances. This measure 1) is easy to compute, 2) reacts reasonably to both blur and random noise, and 3) works well even when the noise is not Gaussian. The proposed measure is used to automatically and effectively set the parameters of two leading image denoising algorithms. Ample simulated and real data experiments support our claims. Furthermore, tests using the TID2008 database show that this measure correlates well with subjective quality evaluations for both blur and noise distortions.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2052820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484579","Denoising;no-reference metric;parameter optimization;sharpness;singular value decomposition","Noise reduction;Noise measurement;Gaussian noise;Distortion measurement;Inverse problems;Risk analysis;Singular value decomposition;Matrix decomposition;Q measurement;Image denoising","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Image Enhancement","255","12","26","IEEE","14 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

PSKA allows neighboring nodes in a BAN to agree to a symmetric (shared) cryptographic key, in an authenticated manner, using physiological signals obtained from the subject. No initialization or predeployment is required; simply deploying sensors in a BAN is enough to make them communicate securely. Our analysis, prototyping, and comparison with the frequently used Diffie–Hellman key agreement protocol shows that PSKA is a viable intersensor key agreement protocol for BANs.

Considering a two time slot two-way relaying scheme, each relay adjusts the phase and the amplitude of the mixture signal it receives from the two transceivers during the first time slot, by multiplying it with a complex beamforming coefficient. Then each relay transmits the so-obtained signal in the second time slot. Aiming at optimally calculating the beamforming coefficients as well as the transceiver transmit powers, we study two different approaches. In the first approach, we minimize the total transmit power (dissipated in the whole network) subject to two constraints on the transceivers' received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We prove that such a power minimization technique has a unique solution. We also show that the optimal weight vector can be obtained through a simple iterative algorithm which enjoys a linear computational complexity per iteration. We also prove that for symmetric relaying schemes (where the two constraints on the transceiver SNRs are the same), half of the minimum total transmit power will be allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among the relaying nodes. In the second approach, we will study an SNR balancing technique. In this technique, the smaller of the two transceiver SNRs is maximized while the total transmit power is kept below a certain power budget. We show that this problem has also a unique solution which can be obtained through an iterative procedure with a linear computational complexity per iteration. We also prove that this approach leads to a power allocation scheme, where half of the maximum power budget is allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among all the relay nodes. For both approaches, we devise distributed schemes which require a minimal cooperation among the two transceivers and the relays. In fact, we show that both techniques can be implemented such that the bandwidth, required to obtain the beamforming weights in a distributed manner, remains constant as the size of the network grows.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2026067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5109699","Ad hoc relay networks;bidirectional relaying;distributed beamforming;distributed signal processing;optimal power allocation;second-order cone programming;SNR balancing;two-way relaying","Array signal processing;Transceivers;Signal processing;Computational complexity;Acoustic signal processing;Digital relays;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors;Iterative algorithms","","254","2","24","IEEE","23 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a novel inference mechanism for an interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic control system (IT2 TSK FLCS) when antecedents are type-2 fuzzy sets and consequents are crisp numbers (A2-C0). The proposed inference mechanism has a closed form which makes it more feasible to analyze the stability of this FLCS. This paper focuses on control applications for the following cases: 1) Both plant and controller use A2-C0 TSK models, and 2) the plant uses type-1 Takagi-Sugeno (TS) and the controller uses IT2 TS models. In both cases, sufficient stability conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system are derived. Furthermore, novel linear-matrix-inequality-based algorithms are developed for satisfying the stability conditions. Numerical analyses are included which validate the effectiveness of the new inference methods. Case studies reveal that an IT2 TS FLCS using the proposed inference engine clearly outperforms its type-1 TSK counterpart. Moreover, due to the simple nature of the proposed inference engine, it is easy to implement in real-time control systems. The methods presented in this paper lay the mathematical foundations for analyzing the stability and facilitating the design of stabilizing controllers of IT2 TSK FLCSs and IT2 TS FLCSs with significantly improved performance over type-1 approaches.","1941-0492","","10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2029986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299179","Adaptive control;modular and reconfigurable robots;robot manipulators;Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK);type-2 fuzzy logic control (T2 FLC)","Fuzzy logic;Control systems;Numerical stability;Inference mechanisms;Stability analysis;Engines;Process control;Uncertainty;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model;Fuzzy sets","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Feedback;Fuzzy Logic;Logistic Models;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","253","","41","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g., HTML, Python, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to easily build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share these devices. In this paper, we begin by describing the Web of Things architecture and best-practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and modularity of the traditional Web.

The family of sign algorithms (SAs) stands out due to its low complexity and robustness against impulsive noise. The proposed APSA combines the benefits of the APA and SA by updating its weight vector according to the L 1-norm optimization criterion while using multiple projections. The features of the APA and the L 1-norm minimization guarantee the APSA an excellent candidate for combatting impulsive interference and speeding up the convergence rate for colored inputs at a low computational complexity. Simulations in a system identification context show that the proposed APSA outperforms the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm, APA, and normalized sign algorithm (NSA) in terms of convergence rate and steady-state error.

While data outsourcing relieves the owners of the burden of local data storage and maintenance, it also eliminates their physical control of storage dependability and security, which traditionally has been expected by both enterprises and individuals with high service-level requirements. In order to facilitate rapid deployment of cloud data storage service and regain security assurances with outsourced data dependability, efficient methods that enable on-demand data correctness verification on behalf of cloud data owners have to be designed. In this article we propose that publicly auditable cloud data storage is able to help this nascent cloud economy become fully established. With public auditability, a trusted entity with expertise and capabilities data owners do not possess can be delegated as an external audit party to assess the risk of outsourced data when needed. Such an auditing service not only helps save data owners¿ computation resources but also provides a transparent yet cost-effective method for data owners to gain trust in the cloud. We describe approaches and system requirements that should be brought into consideration, and outline challenges that need to be resolved for such a publicly auditable secure cloud storage service to become a reality.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2010.5510914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510914","","Memory;Secure storage;Data security;Cloud computing;Computer vision;Cryptography;Outsourcing;Protocols;Risk management;Data storage systems","","252","3","18","IEEE","19 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In the framework of information theory, the compressibility of a signal implies that it can be decomposed onto a reduced set of basic elements. Since the same quantity of information is carried by the original signal and its decomposition, it can be deduced that a certain degree of redundancy exists in the explicit representation. According to the theory of compressive sensing (CS), due to this redundancy, it is possible to infer an accurate representation of an unknown compressible signal through a highly incomplete set of measurements. Based on this assumption, this paper proposes a novel method for the focusing of raw data in the framework of radar imaging. The technique presented is introduced as an alternative option to the traditional matched filtering, and it suggests that the new modes of acquisition of data are more efficient in orbital configurations. In this paper, this method is first tested on 1-D simulated signals, and results are discussed. An experiment with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) raw data is also described. Its purpose is to show the potential of CS applied to SAR systems. In particular, we show that an image can be reconstructed, without the loss of resolution, after dropping a large percentage of the received pulses, which would allow the implementation of wide-swath modes without reducing the azimuth resolution.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504101","Compressive sensing (CS);$l_{1}$  minimization;linear programming;matched filter;sparsity;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Radar imaging;Image resolution;Radar applications;Information theory;Extraterrestrial measurements;Focusing;Matched filters;Filtering;Testing;Synthetic aperture radar","","252","","28","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A sequence of random variables, all of which are mutually independent but obey Bernoulli distribution, are introduced to account for the randomly occurred communication delays. The packet dropout phenomenon occurs in a random way and the occurrence probability for each sensor is governed by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution in the interval. The discrete-time system under consideration is also subject to parameter uncertainties, state-dependent stochastic disturbances and sector-bounded nonlinearities. We aim to design a linear full-order filter such that the estimation error converges to zero exponentially in the mean square while the disturbance rejection attenuation is constrained to a give level by means of the H∞ performance index. Intensive stochastic analysis is carried out to obtain sufficient conditions for ensuring the exponential stability as well as prescribed H∞ performance for the overall filtering error dynamics, in the presence of random delays, random dropouts, nonlinearities, and the parameter uncertainties. These conditions are characterized in terms of the feasibility of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and then the explicit expression is given for the desired filter parameters.

The advantages of MBKPLS are: 1) MBKPLS can capture more useful information between and within blocks compared to partial least squares (PLS); 2) MBKPLS gives nonlinear interpretation compared to MBPLS; 3) Fault diagnosis becomes possible if number of sub-blocks is equal to the number of the variables compared to KPLS. The proposed methods are applied to process monitoring of a continuous annealing process. Application results indicate that the proposed decentralized monitoring scheme effectively captures the complex relations in the process and improves the diagnosis ability tremendously.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2009.2033181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340619","Fault diagnosis;multiblock kernel partial least squares (MBKPLS);nonlinear component analysis;process monitoring","Fault diagnosis;Large-scale systems;Kernel;Least squares methods;Principal component analysis;Monitoring;Covariance matrix;Artificial neural networks;Chemical industry;Neural networks","","252","","27","IEEE","24 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that, using lattice codes and lattice decoding, we can obtain a rate of 1/2 log(1/2 + snr) bits per transmitter, which is essentially optimal at high SNR. The main idea is to decode the sum of the codewords modulo a lattice at the relay followed by a broadcast phase which performs Slepian-Wolf coding. We also show that if the two transmitters use identical lattices with minimum angle decoding, we can achieve the same rate of 1/2 log(1/2 + snr).

This paper efficiently copes with these challenges with a decentralized group-authentication protocol in the sense that the group is maintained by each roadside unit (RSU) rather than by a centralized authority, as in most existing protocols that are employing group signatures. In our proposal, we employ each RSU to maintain and manage an on-the-fly group within its communication range. Vehicles entering the group can anonymously broadcast vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messages, which can be instantly verified by the vehicles in the same group (and neighboring groups). Later, if the message is found to be false, a third party can be invoked to disclose the identity of the message originator. Our protocol efficiently exploits the specific features of vehicular mobility, physical road limitations, and properly distributed RSUs. Our design leads to a robust VANET since, if some RSUs occasionally collapse, only the vehicles that are driving in those collapsed areas will be affected. Due to the numerous RSUs sharing the load to maintain the system, performance does not significantly degrade when more vehicles join the VANET; hence, the system is scalable.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2038222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353646","Conditional privacy;information security;protocol design;vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)","Robustness;Authentication;Protocols;Vehicles;Ad hoc networks;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Proposals;Broadcasting;Roads","","252","","42","IEEE","15 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first consider the distribution of intercontact times between mobile devices. Using a diverse set of measured mobility traces, we find as an invariant property that there is a characteristic time, order of half a day, beyond which the distribution decays exponentially. Up to this value, the distribution in many cases follows a power law, as shown in recent work. This power law finding was previously used to support the hypothesis that intercontact time has a power law tail, and that common mobility models are not adequate. However, we observe that the timescale of interest for opportunistic forwarding may be of the same order as the characteristic time, and thus, the exponential tail is important. We further show that already simple models such as random walk and random waypoint can exhibit the same dichotomy in the distribution of intercontact time as in empirical traces. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis of several properties of human mobility patterns across several dimensions, and we present empirical evidence that the return time of a mobile device to its favorite location site may already explain the observed dichotomy. Our findings suggest that existing results on the performance of forwarding schemes based on power law tails might be overly pessimistic.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2010.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473233","Measurement;mobile communication;modeling.","Tail;Humans;Protocols;Mobile communication;Time measurement;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Distribution functions;Probability distribution;Delay effects","","251","","19","IEEE","27 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CP radiation can be achieved by slightly asymmetric (unbalanced) patch along the diagonal directions by slot areas. Four symmetric-slits are also embedded symmetrically along the orthogonal directions of the asymmetric-circular shaped slotted patch to further reduce antenna size.

By serving each terminal through several base stations in a given area, intercell interference can be coordinated and higher performance achieved, especially for terminals at cell edges. Most previous work in the area has assumed that base stations have common knowledge of both data dedicated to all terminals and full or partial channel state information (CSI) of all links. Herein, we analyze the case of distributed cooperation where each base station has only local CSI, either instantaneous or statistical. In the case of instantaneous CSI, the beamforming vectors that can attain the outer boundary of the achievable rate region are characterized for an arbitrary number of multiantenna transmitters and single-antenna receivers. This characterization only requires local CSI and justifies distributed precoding design based on a novel virtual signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) framework, which can handle an arbitrary SNR and achieves the optimal multiplexing gain. The local power allocation between terminals is solved heuristically. Conceptually, analogous results for the achievable rate region characterization and precoding design are derived in the case of local statistical CSI. The benefits of distributed cooperative transmission are illustrated numerically, and it is shown that most of the performance with centralized cooperation can be obtained using only local CSI.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2049996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462883","Coordinated multipoint (CoMP);network multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO);base station cooperation;distributed precoding;rate region;virtual signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR)","Base stations;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;MIMO;Channel state information;Array signal processing;Transmitters;Signal design;Councils;Wireless networks","","248","16","31","IEEE","10 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Radar has long been a staple of signal processing, and MIMO radar presents challenges and opportunities in adapting classical radar imaging tools and developing new ones. Our aim in this article is to showcase the potential of tensor algebra and multidimensional harmonic retrieval (HR) in signal processing for MIMO radar. Tensor algebra and multidimensional HR are relatively mature topics, albeit still on the fringes of signal processing research. We show they are in fact central for target localization in a variety of pertinent MIMO radar scenarios. Tensor algebra naturally comes into play when the coherent processing interval comprises multiple pulses, or multiple transmit and receive subarrays are used (multistatic configuration). Multidimensional harmonic structure emerges for far-field uniform linear transmit/receive array configurations, also taking into account Doppler shift; and hybrid models arise in-between. This viewpoint opens the door for the application and further development of powerful algorithms and identifiability results for MIMO radar. Compared to the classical radar-imaging-based methods such as Capon or MUSIC, these algebraic techniques yield improved performance, especially for closely spaced targets, at modest complexity.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2058802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510180","DoA-DoD estimation;harmonic retrieval;localization;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;tensor decomposition","Radar signal processing;Tensile stress;Algebra;Multidimensional signal processing;MIMO;Radar imaging;Doppler radar;Radar detection;Multidimensional systems;Doppler shift","","248","1","51","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as we demonstrate in this work, the limitation of the current method of extracting SPNs is that the SPNs extracted from images can be severely contaminated by details from scenes, and as a result, the identification rate is unsatisfactory unless images of a large size are used. In this work, we propose a novel approach for attenuating the influence of details from scenes on SPNs so as to improve the device identification rate of the identifier. The hypothesis underlying our SPN enhancement method is that the stronger a signal component in an SPN is, the less trustworthy the component should be, and thus should be attenuated. This hypothesis suggests that an enhanced SPN can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the SPN components.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2046268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439866","Digital forensics;digital investigation;multimedia forensics;sensor pattern noise (SPN);source device identification","Digital images;Forensics;Object recognition;Layout;Digital cameras;Sensor arrays;Image sensors;Semiconductor device noise;Joining processes;Lenses","","248","3","25","IEEE","29 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a particular configuration of sensors, this technique exploits the structure of the probability distributions of the target state and of the sensor measurements to control the mobile sensors such that future observations minimize the expected future uncertainty of the target state. The mutual information between the sensors and the target state is computed using a particle filter representation of the posterior probability distribution, making it possible to directly use nonlinear and non-Gaussian target state and sensor models. To make the approach scalable to increasing network sizes, single-node and pairwise-node approximations to the mutual information are derived for general probability density models, with analytically bounded error. The pairwise-node approximation is proven to be a more accurate objective function than the single-node approximation. The mobile sensors are cooperatively controlled using a distributed optimization, yielding coordinated motion of the network. These methods are explored for various sensing modalities, including bearings-only sensing, range-only sensing, and magnetic field sensing, all with potential for search and rescue applications. For each sensing modality, the behavior of this non-parametric method is compared and contrasted with the results of linearized methods, and simulations are performed of a target search using the dynamics of actual vehicles. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that as network size increases, the sensors more quickly localize the target, and the pairwise-node approximation provides superior performance to the single-node approximation. The proposed methods are shown to produce similar results to linearized methods in particular scenarios, yet they capture effects in more general scenarios that are not possible with linearized methods.

The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally.

As the system mean-time-before-failure correspondingly drops, applications must checkpoint more frequently to make progress. However, as the system memory sizes grow faster than the bandwidth to the parallel file system, the cost of checkpointing begins to dominate application run times. Multi-level checkpointing potentially solves this problem through multiple types of checkpoints with different costs and different levels of resiliency in a single run. This solution employs lightweight checkpoints to handle the most common failure modes and relies on more expensive checkpoints for less common, but more severe failures. This theoretically promising approach has not been fully evaluated in a large- scale, production system context. We have designed the Scalable Checkpoint/Restart (SCR) library, a multi-level checkpoint system that writes checkpoints to RAM, Flash, or disk on the compute nodes in addition to the parallel file system. We present the performance and reliability properties of SCR as well as a probabilistic Markov model that predicts its performance on current and future systems. We show that multi-level checkpointing improves efficiency on existing large-scale systems and that this benefit increases as the system size grows. In particular, we developed low-cost checkpoint schemes that are 100x-1000x faster than the parallel file system and effective against 85% of our system failures. This leads to a gain in machine efficiency of up to 35%, and it reduces the the load on the parallel file system by a factor of two on current and future systems.","2167-4337","978-1-4244-7559-9","10.1109/SC.2010.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645453","","Thyristors;Checkpointing;Random access memory;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Bandwidth;Redundancy","","247","7","32","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this heterogeneity, it may be most cost effective to set up different lightpaths at different bit rates in such a backbone telecom mesh network employing optical wavelength-division multiplexing. This approach can be cost effective because low-bit-rate services will need less grooming (i.e., less multiplexing with other low-bit-rate services onto high-capacity wavelengths), while a high-bit-rate service can be accommodated directly on a wavelength itself. Optical networks with mixed line rates (MLRs), e.g., 10/40/100 Gb/s over different wavelength channels, are a new networking paradigm. The unregenerated reach of a lightpath depends on its line rate. So, the assignment of a line rate to a lightpath is a tradeoff between its capacity and transparent reach. Thus, based on their signal-quality constraints (threshold bit error rate), intelligent assignment of line rates to lightpaths can minimize the need for signal regeneration. This constraint on the transparent reach based on threshold signal quality can be relaxed by employing more advanced modulation formats, but with more investment. We propose a design method for MLR optical networks with transceivers employing different modulation formats. Our results demonstrate the tradeoff between a transceiver's cost and its optical reach in overall network design.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2009.2034396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286317","Bit error rate (BER);differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK);duobinary;maximum transparent reach;mixed line rate (MLR);multiple modulation format;network design;optical network;signal regeneration;wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)","Optical fiber networks;Optical design;Modulation;Costs;Telecommunication traffic;Bit rate;Spine;Mesh networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks","","247","","25","IEEE","13 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such signals are generally called quasi-stationary or locally stationary signals. This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of quasi-stationary signals. Specifically, in our problem formulation we assume: i) sensor array of uniform linear structure; ii) mutually uncorrelated wide-sense quasi-stationary source signals; and iii) wide-sense stationary noise process with unknown, possibly nonwhite, spatial covariance. Under the assumptions above and by judiciously examining the structures of local second-order statistics (SOSs), we develop a Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace approach that has two notable advantages. First, through an identifiability analysis, it is proven that this KR subspace approach can operate even when the number of sensors is about half of the number of sources. The idea behind is to make use of a ¿virtual¿ array structure provided inherently in the local SOS model, of which the degree of freedom is about twice of that of the physical array. Second, the KR formulation naturally provides a simple yet effective way of eliminating the unknown spatial noise covariance from the signal SOSs. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the KR subspace approach under various situations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2034935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290056","Khatri–Rao subspace;Kruskal-rank;quasi-stationary signals (QSS);second-order statistics;underdetermined direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation;unknown noise covariance","Direction of arrival estimation;Sensor arrays;Signal processing;Statistics;Semiconductor device noise;Councils;Speech processing;Microphone arrays;Array signal processing;Birds","","246","","31","IEEE","20 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, no extra current control loops are required, thereby simplifying the system design and enhancing the transient performance. Constant converter switching frequency is achieved by using space vector modulation, which eases the designs of the power converter and the ac harmonic filter. Simulation results on a 2-MW grid-connected DFIG system are provided and compared with those of classic voltage-oriented vector control (VC) and conventional lookup table (LUT) DPC.

However, from a thermal perspective, vertical integration of high-performance ICs in the form of 3D stacks is highly demanding since the effective areal heat dissipation increases with number of dies (with hotspot heat fluxes up to 250 W/cm2) generating high chip temperatures. In this context, inter-tier integrated microchannel cooling is a promising and scalable solution for high heat flux removal. A robust design of a 3D IC and its subsequent thermal management depend heavily upon accurate modeling of the effects of liquid cooling on the thermal behavior of the IC during the early stages of design. In this paper we present 3D-ICE, a compact transient thermal model (CTTM) for the thermal simulation of 3D ICs with multiple inter-tier microchannel liquid cooling. The proposed model is compatible with existing thermal CAD tools for ICs, and offers significant speed-up (up to 975x) over a typical commercial computational fluid dynamics simulation tool while preserving accuracy (i.e., maximum temperature error of 3.4%). In addition, a thermal simulator has been built based on 3D-ICE, which is capable of running in parallel on multicore architectures, offering further savings in simulation time and demonstrating efficient parallelization of the proposed approach.","1558-2434","978-1-4244-8194-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2010.5653749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5653749","Compact modeling;microchannel;3D IC;inter-tier cooling","Integrated circuit modeling;Microchannel;Heating;Three dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Mathematical model","","246","3","30","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The detection mechanism is internal photoemission from the metal film into the semiconductor substrate. Three detector configurations are considered: the first consists of a thick metal film on a semiconductor substrate forming a single Schottky barrier; the second consists of a thin metal film on a semiconductor substrate also forming a single Schottky barrier; and the third consists of a thin metal film buried in semiconductor and forming two Schottky barriers (one along each metal-semiconductor interface). In the three cases, illumination through the semiconductor substrate is assumed. The two thin-film configurations provide enhanced internal quantum efficiencies due to multiple hot carrier reflections within the metal film, with the double-barrier case providing the greatest enhancement due to emission over two barriers. The models proposed are based on assessing the emission probability of hot carriers as a function of their energy, taking into account multiple reflections within the metal film and energy losses due to internal scattering (e.g., with phonons and cold carriers). The thin-film single-barrier model was tested via comparisons with responsivity measurements reported in the literature for PtSi/p-Si and Pd2Si/p-Si detectors.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2010.2046720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5485040","Infrared;internal photoemission;photodetector;Schottky contact","Transistors;Schottky barriers;Photodetectors;Optical films;Semiconductor films;Substrates;Semiconductor thin films;Optical scattering;Hot carriers;Optical reflection","","246","5","43","IEEE","14 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These results lead to a direct implementation of Whittle index policy with remarkably low complexity. When arms are stochastically identical, we show that Whittle index policy is optimal under certain conditions. Furthermore, it has a semiuniversal structure that obviates the need to know the Markov transition probabilities. The optimality and the semiuniversal structure result from the equivalence between Whittle index policy and the myopic policy established in this work. For nonidentical arms, we develop efficient algorithms for computing a performance upper bound given by Lagrangian relaxation. The tightness of the upper bound and the near-optimal performance of Whittle index policy are illustrated with simulation examples.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2068950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605371","Dynamic channel selection;indexability;myopic policy;opportunistic access;restless multiarmed bandit (RMAB);Whittle index","Indexes;Markov processes;Upper bound;Approximation methods;Complexity theory;Sensors;Channel models","","245","","36","IEEE","18 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They achieve the symmetric capacity of arbitrary binary-input discrete memoryless channels under a low complexity successive cancellation decoding scheme. The original polar code construction is closely related to the recursive construction of Reed-Muller codes and is based on the 2 × 2 matrix [1 0 : 1 1]. It was shown by Arikan Telatar that this construction achieves an error exponent of 1/2, i.e., that for sufficiently large blocklengths the error probability decays exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. It was already mentioned by Arikan that in principle larger matrices can be used to construct polar codes. In this paper, it is first shown that any ℓ × ℓ matrix none of whose column permutations is upper triangular polarizes binary-input memoryless channels. The exponent of a given square matrix is characterized, upper and lower bounds on achievable exponents are given. Using these bounds it is shown that there are no matrices of size smaller than 15×15 with exponents exceeding 1/2. Further, a general construction based on BCH codes which for large I achieves exponents arbitrarily close to 1 is given. At size 16 × 16, this construction yields an exponent greater than 1/2.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2080990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625639","Polar codes;channel polarization;polar code construction;rate of polarization;error exponent","Memoryless systems;Complexity theory;Error probability;Symmetric matrices;Polarization","","245","8","7","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is verified against electrostatic measurements as well as a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulation tool and subsequently employed for various performance (delay) analyses. The compact model is also applicable to TSVs made of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles, once a slight modification (making the effective conductivity complex) is made. Various geometries (as per the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) and prospective materials (Cu, W, and single-walled/multiwalled CNTs) are evaluated, and a comparative performance analysis is presented. It is shown that CNT-bundle-based TSVs can offer smaller or comparable high-frequency resistance than those of other materials due to the reduced skin effect in CNT bundle structures. On the other hand, the performance (delay) analysis indicates that the performance differences among different TSV materials are rather small. However, it is shown that CNTs provide an improved heat dissipation path due to their much higher thermal conductivity.

EEE uses a Low Power Idle mode to reduce the energy consumption of a link when no packets are being sent. In this article, we describe the development of the EEE standard and how energy savings resulting from the adoption of EEE may exceed $400 million per year in the U.S. alone (and over $1 billion worldwide). We also present results from a simulation-based performance evaluation showing how packet coalescing can be used to improve the energy efficiency of EEE. Our results show that packet coalescing can significantly improve energy efficiency while keeping absolute packet delays to tolerable bounds. We are aware that coalescing may cause packet loss in downstream buffers, especially when using TCP/IP. We explore the effects of coalescing on TCP/IP flows with an ns-2 simulation, note that coalescing is already used to reduce packet processing load on the system CPU, and suggest open questions for future work. This article will help clarify what can be expected when EEE is deployed.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2010.5621967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5621967","","Ethernet networks;Energy efficiency;Delay;Servers;IEEE 802.3 Standards;Wireless networks","","242","23","11","IEEE","4 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Static or semi-static interference coordination based schemes provide enhanced cell-edge performance but with severe penalty to the overall cell throughput. Furthermore, static resource planning makes these schemes unsuitable for applications in which frequency planning is difficult, such as femtocell networks. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic interference avoidance scheme that makes use of inter-cell coordination in order to prevent excessive inter-cell interference, especially for cell or sector edge users that are most affected by inter-cell interference, with minimal or no impact on the network throughput. The proposed scheme is comprised of a two-level algorithm - one at the base station level and the other at a central controller to which a group of neighboring base stations are connected. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the reference schemes, in which either coordination is not employed (reuse of 1) or employed in a static manner (reuse of 3 and fractional frequency reuse), in terms of cell edge throughput with a minimal impact on the network throughput and with some increase in complexity.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441362","OFDMA resource allocation, interference avoidance, resource optimization, inter-cell coordination.

The ability to detect falls events in an unsupervised manner would lead to improved prognoses for falls victims. Several wearable accelerometry and gyroscope-based falls detection devices have been described in the literature; however, they all suffer from unacceptable false positive rates. This paper investigates the augmentation of such systems with a barometric pressure sensor, as a surrogate measure of altitude, to assist in discriminating real fall events from normal activities of daily living. The acceleration and air pressure data are recorded using a wearable device attached to the subject's waist and analyzed offline. The study incorporates several protocols including simulated falls onto a mattress and simulated activities of daily living, in a cohort of 20 young healthy volunteers (12 male and 8 female; age: $23.7 \pm 3.0$  years). A heuristically trained decision tree classifier is used to label suspected falls. The proposed system demonstrated considerable improvements in comparison to an existing accelerometry-based technique; showing an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 96.9%, 97.5%, and 96.5%, respectively, in the indoor environment, with no false positives generated during extended testing during activities of daily living. This is compared to 85.3%, 75%, and 91.5% for the same measures, respectively, when using accelerometry alone. The increased specificity of this system may enhance the usage of falls detectors among the elderly population.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2070807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559476","Accelerometer;ambulatory monitoring;barometric pressure;fall;fall detection","Classification algorithms;Acceleration;Accelerometers;Wearable sensors;Geriatrics;Legged locomotion;Event detection","Acceleration;Accidental Falls;Activities of Daily Living;Air Pressure;Algorithms;Analog-Digital Conversion;Automatic Data Processing;Decision Trees;Equipment Design;False Negative Reactions;False Positive Reactions;Female;Humans;Male;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Young Adult","241","7","24","IEEE","30 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, its performance in EEG classification deteriorates if the number of training samples is small. To address this concern, a regularized CSP (R-CSP) algorithm is proposed, where the covariance-matrix estimation is regularized by two parameters to lower the estimation variance while reducing the estimation bias. To tackle the problem of regularization parameter determination, R-CSP with aggregation (R-CSP-A) is further proposed, where a number of R-CSPs are aggregated to give an ensemble-based solution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on data set IVa of BCI Competition III against four other competing algorithms. Experiments show that R-CSP-A significantly outperforms the other methods in average classification performance in three sets of experiments across various testing scenarios, with particular superiority in SSS.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2010.2082540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593203","Aggregation;brain–computer interface (BCI);common spatial pattern (CSP);electroencephalogram (EEG);generic learning;regularization;small sample","Electroencephalography;Covariance matrix;Training;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Brain computer interfaces","Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","241","","40","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first describe a probabilistic model of interaural parameters that can be evaluated at individual spectrogram points. By creating a mixture of these models over sources and delays, the multi-source localization problem is reduced to a collection of single source problems. We derive an expectation-maximization algorithm for computing the maximum-likelihood parameters of this mixture model, and show that these parameters correspond well with interaural parameters measured in isolation. As a byproduct of fitting this mixture model, the algorithm creates probabilistic spectrogram masks that can be used for source separation.

Alternatively, learning-based SR approaches use a large database of exemplar images for “hallucinating” detail. The quality of the upsampled image, especially about edges, is dependent on the suitability of the training images. This paper aims to combine the benefits of edge-directed SR with those of learning-based SR. In particular, we propose an approach to extend edge-directed super-resolution to include detail from an image/texture example provided by the user (e.g., from the Internet). A significant benefit of our approach is that only a single exemplar image is required to supply the missing detail - strong edges are obtained in the SR image even if they are not present in the example image due to the combination of the edge-directed approach. In addition, we can achieve quality results at very large magnification, which is often problematic for both edge-directed and learning-based approaches.","1063-6919","978-1-4244-6985-7","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539933","","Image resolution;Strontium;Image reconstruction;Statistical distributions;Nearest neighbor searches;Image databases;Interpolation;Frequency estimation;Training data;Asia","","239","8","30","IEEE","5 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next, in order to reduce the number of measured signals, a T-S fuzzy observer is developed for state feedback. Then, a fuzzy direct MPPT controller is proposed to achieve asymptotic MPPT control, in which the observer and controller gains are obtained by separately solving two sets of linear matrix inequalities. Different from the traditional MPPT approaches, the proposed T-S fuzzy controller directly drives the system to the maximum power point without searching the maximum power point and measuring insolation. Furthermore, when considering disturbance and uncertainty, robust MPPT is guaranteed by advanced gain design. Therefore, the proposed method provides an easier implementation form under strict stability analysis.

The method is demonstrated at the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena testbed on quadrotor helicopters performing and improving on flips, double flips and triple flips.","1050-4729","978-1-4244-5038-1","10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509452","","Helicopters;Aerodynamics;Error correction;Design methodology;Vehicle dynamics;Jacobian matrices;Robotics and automation;USA Councils;Gradient methods;Iterative methods","","238","9","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each tree in the MSF grown from a marker forms a region in the segmentation map.

The parasitic resistance associated with the interconnects further degrades the output signal and imposes an additional limitation on the maximum allowable array size. In this paper, we study the device requirements of a resistive cross-point memory array under the worst-case write and read operations. We focus on the data pattern dependence of the memory array and compare the effect of the memory cell resistance values and resistance ratio for determining the maximum array size. The number of cells in the array can reach 106 with a signal swing > 50% of the reading voltage when Ron is beyond 3 M and Roff/Ron is greater than 2. A large memory cell resistance value can further reduce the power consumption, obviate the need for a large Roff/Ron ratio, and avoid the inclusion of cell selection devices. The effect of the nonlinearity of the I -V characteristics of the memory cells is also investigated. The nonlinearity calls for a substantial tradeoff between the memory cell resistance values and the resistance ratio, and must be taken into consideration for the device design.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2010.2062187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5555968","Cross-point memory;memory cell selection device;nonlinearity;resistance ratio;resistance values;sneak path leakage","Arrays;Resistance;Microprocessors;Memory management;Integrated circuit interconnections;Sensors","","237","9","28","IEEE","23 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider the problem of semi-supervised feature selection, where we are given a small amount of labeled examples and a large amount of unlabeled examples. Since a small number of labeled samples are usually insufficient for identifying the relevant features, the critical problem arising from semi-supervised feature selection is how to take advantage of the information underneath the unlabeled data. To address this problem, we propose a novel discriminative semi-supervised feature selection method based on the idea of manifold regularization. The proposed approach selects features through maximizing the classification margin between different classes and simultaneously exploiting the geometry of the probability distribution that generates both labeled and unlabeled data. In comparison with previous semi-supervised feature selection algorithms, our proposed semi-supervised feature selection method is an embedded feature selection method and is able to find more discriminative features. We formulate the proposed feature selection method into a convex-concave optimization problem, where the saddle point corresponds to the optimal solution. To find the optimal solution, the level method, a fairly recent optimization method, is employed. We also present a theoretic proof of the convergence rate for the application of the level method to our problem. Empirical evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised feature selection method.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2047114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491193","Feature selection;level method;manifold regularization;multiple kernel learning;semi-supervised learning","Biosensors;Data mining;Optimization methods;Computer science;Bioinformatics;Sensor systems;Training data;Communities;Information geometry;Probability distribution","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Mining;Decision Support Techniques;Humans;Learning","236","","69","IEEE","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a circuit topology and input switching activity, we propose an efficient method to predict the degradation of circuit speed over a long period of time. The effectiveness of our method is comprehensively demonstrated with the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) benchmarks and a 65-nm industrial design. Furthermore, we extract the following key design insights for reliable circuit design under NBTI effect, including: 1) During dynamic operation, NBTI-induced degradation is relatively insensitive to supply voltage, but strongly dependent on temperature; 2) There is an optimum supply voltage that leads to the minimum of circuit performance degradation; circuit degradation rate actually goes up if supply voltage is lower than the optimum value; 3) Circuit performance degradation due to NBTI is highly sensitive to input vectors. The difference in delay degradation is up to 5× for various static and dynamic operations.

Accordingly, there is a great need for digital image forensic techniques capable of detecting image alterations and forged images. A number of image processing operations, such as histogram equalization or gamma correction, are equivalent to pixel value mappings. In this paper, we show that pixel value mappings leave behind statistical traces, which we shall refer to as a mapping's intrinsic fingerprint, in an image's pixel value histogram. We then propose forensic methods for detecting general forms globally and locally applied contrast enhancement as well as a method for identifying the use of histogram equalization by searching for the identifying features of each operation's intrinsic fingerprint. Additionally, we propose a method to detect the global addition of noise to a previously JPEG-compressed image by observing that the intrinsic fingerprint of a specific mapping will be altered if it is applied to an image's pixel values after the addition of noise. Through a number of simulations, we test the efficacy of each proposed forensic technique. Our simulation results show that aside from exceptional cases, all of our detection methods are able to correctly detect the use of their designated image processing operation with a probability of 99% given a false alarm probability of 7% or less.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2053202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487389","Contrast enhancement;digital forensics;digital image forgery;intrinsic fingerprints;pixel value histograms","Forensics;Fingerprint recognition;Digital images;Forgery;Histograms;Image processing;Law;Legal factors;Educational institutions;Transform coding","","236","3","23","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its unique security advantages in isolating and introspecting commodity OSes as virtual machines (VMs) have enabled a wide spectrum of applications. However, a common, fundamental assumption is the presence of a trustworthy hypervisor. Unfortunately, the large code base of commodity hypervisors and recent successful hypervisor attacks (e.g., VM escape) seriously question the validity of this assumption. In this paper, we present HyperSafe, a lightweight approach that endows existing Type-I bare-metal hypervisors with a unique self-protection capability to provide lifetime control flow integrity. Specifically, we propose two key techniques. The first one, non-bypassable memory lockdown, reliably protects the hypervisor's code and static data from being compromised even in the presence of exploitable memory corruption bugs (e.g., buffer overflows), therefore successfully providing hypervisor code integrity. The second one, restricted pointer indexing, introduces one layer of indirection to convert the control data into pointer indexes. These pointer indexes are restricted such that the corresponding call/return targets strictly follow the hypervisor control flow graph, hence expanding protection to control-flow integrity. We have built a prototype and used it to protect two open-source Type-I hypervisors: BitVisor and Xen. The experimental results with synthetic hypervisor exploits and benchmarking programs show HyperSafe can reliably enable the hypervisor self-protection and provide the integrity guarantee with a small performance overhead.","2375-1207","978-1-4244-6895-9","10.1109/SP.2010.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504800","Hypervisor;Rootkits;Control-Flow Integrity","Virtual machine monitors;Lighting control;Protection;Security;Virtual machining;Voice mail;Virtual manufacturing;Computer bugs;Buffer overflow;Indexing","","236","23","59","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The focus in this study is the fuel reduction that heavy duty vehicle platooning enables and the analysis with respect to the influence of a commercial adaptive cruise control on the fuel consumption. Experimental results show that by using preview information of the road ahead from the lead vehicle, the adaptive cruise controller can reduce the fuel consumption. A study is undertaken for various masses of the lead vehicle. The results show that the best choice with respect to a heavier or lighter lead vehicle depends on the desired time gap. A maximum fuel reduction of 4.7-7.7% depending on the time gap, at a set speed of 70 km/h, can be obtained with two identical trucks. If the lead vehicle is 10 t lighter a corresponding 3.8-7.4% fuel reduction can be obtained depending on the time gap. Similarly if the lead vehicle is 10 t heavier a 4.3-6.9% fuel reduction can be obtained. All results indicate that a maximum fuel reduction can be achieved at a short relative distance, due to both air drag reduction and suitable control.","2153-0017","978-1-4244-7659-6","10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625054","","Vehicles;Fuels;Lead;Roads;Mathematical model;Engines;Drag","","235","18","17","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first component, we propose five heuristics to enumerate simple combinations of known phishing sites to discover new phishing URLs. The second component consists of an approximate matching algorithm that dissects a URL into multiple components that are matched individually against entries in the blacklist. In our evaluation with real-time blacklist feeds, we discovered around 18,000 new phishing URLs from a set of 6,000 new blacklist entries.

These two types of robots for automated power line inspection are critically assessed according to four important characteristics: design requirements, inspection quality, autonomy and universality of inspection. Besides, some general not yet identified problems and tasks of inspection robots, which should be addressed in the future, are presented. In conclusion, the two robot types have specific benefits and drawbacks so that none can currently be considered generally advantageous.

For such systems, the use of a multiple-input converter (MIC) has the advantage of simpler circuit structure and lower cost, compared to the use of several single-input converters. By decomposing converters into basic cells, namely, pulsating source cells and output filters, a set of basic rules for generating multiple-input converter topologies is proposed. Specifically, two families of multiple-input converters are systematically generated. In the first family of MICs, all the input sources can power the load simultaneously or individually. In the second family, only one power source is allowed to transfer energy to the load at a time.

However, the demand for ""larger"" wireless infrastructure is emerging, ranging from office/university campuses to city-wide deployments. To overcome the limitations of singlehop communication, data packets need to traverse over multiple wireless hops, and wireless mesh networks are called for. Since 2004 Task Group S has been developing an amendment to the 802.11 standard to exactly address the aforementioned need for multihop communication. Besides introducing wireless frame forwarding and routing capabilities at the MAC layer, the 802.11s amendment brings new interworking and security.

This uncertainty arises due to uncertain state estimation, disturbances, and modeling errors, as well as stochastic mode transitions such as component failures. Chance-constrained control takes into account uncertainty to ensure that the probability of failure, due to collision with obstacles, for example, is below a given threshold. In this paper, we present a novel method for chance-constrained predictive stochastic control of dynamic systems. The method approximates the distribution of the system state using a finite number of particles. By expressing these particles in terms of the control variables, we are able to approximate the original stochastic control problem as a deterministic one; furthermore, the approximation becomes exact as the number of particles tends to infinity. This method applies to arbitrary noise distributions, and for systems with linear or jump Markov linear dynamics, we show that the approximate problem can be solved using efficient mixed-integer linear-programming techniques. We also introduce an important weighting extension that enables the method to deal with low-probability mode transitions such as failures. We demonstrate in simulation that the new method is able to control an aircraft in turbulence and can control a ground vehicle while being robust to brake failures.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2010.2044948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477242","Chance constraints;hybrid discrete-continuous systems;nonholonomic motion planning;planning under stochastic uncertainty","Stochastic processes;Predictive control;Uncertainty;Control systems;Robust control;Vehicle dynamics;Robots;State estimation;Stochastic systems;Stochastic resonance","","234","3","58","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several techniques have been proposed in the specialized literature to ensure good convergence and diversity of the obtained solutions. However, in real world applications, the decision maker is not interested in the overall Pareto optimal front since the final decision is a unique solution. Recently, there has been an increased emphasis in addressing the decision-making task in searching for the most preferred alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the Pareto dominance relation, called r-dominance, which has the ability to create a strict partial order among Pareto-equivalent solutions. This fact makes such a relation able to guide the search toward the interesting parts of the Pareto optimal region based on the decision maker's preferences expressed as a set of aspiration levels. After integrating the new dominance relation in the NSGA-II methodology, the efficacy and the usefulness of the modified procedure are assessed through two to ten-objective test problems a priori and interactively. Moreover, the proposed approach provides competitive and better results when compared to other recently proposed preference-based EMO approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2041060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453088","Decision maker's preferences;evolutionary algorithms;interactive multiobjective optimization;Pareto dominance;reference point method","Decision making;Delta modulation;Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Engineering management;Testing;Constraint optimization;Operations research;Shape;Sorting","","234","","48","IEEE","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these is the composition, i.e., the capability to recursively construct a composite Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services, which are developed by different organizations and offer diverse functionalities (e.g., ticket purchase, payment), transactional properties (e.g., compensatable or not), and Quality of Service (QoS) values (e.g., execution price, success rate). The selection of a Web service, for each activity of the workflow, meeting the user's requirements, is still an important challenge. Indeed, the selection of one Web service among a set of them that fulfill some functionalities is a critical task, generally depending on a combined evaluation of QoS. However, the conventional QoS-aware composition approaches do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics. We propose a selection algorithm that satisfies user's preferences, expressed as weights over QoS criteria and as risk levels defining semantically the transactional requirements.

We approach this problem using an error state formulation of the Kalman filter. Integration of the vehicle's high-rate inertial measurement unit's (IMU's) accelerometers and gyros allow time propagation while other sensors provide measurement corrections. The low-rate aiding sensors include a Doppler velocity log (DVL), an acoustic long baseline (LBL) system that provides round-trip travel times from known locations, a pressure sensor for aiding depth, and an attitude sensor. Measurements correct the filter independently as they arrive, and as such, the filter is not dependent on the arrival of any particular measurement. We propose novel tightly coupled techniques for the incorporation of the LBL and DVL measurements. In particular, the LBL correction properly accounts for the error state throughout the measurement cycle via the state transition matrix. Alternate tightly coupled approaches ignore the error state, utilizing only the navigation state to account for the physical latencies in the measurement cycle. These approaches account for neither the uncertainty of vehicle trajectory between interrogation and reply, nor the error state at interrogation. The navigation system also estimates critical sensor calibration parameters to improve performance. The result is a robust navigation system.

More specifically, in the proposed STSK scheme one out of Q dispersion matrices is activated during each transmitted block, which enables us to strike a flexible diversity and multiplexing tradeoff. This is achieved by optimizing both the space-time block duration as well as the number of the dispersion matrices in addition to the number of transmit and receive antennas. We will demonstrate that the resultant equivalent system model does not impose any Inter-Channel Interference (ICI), and hence the employment of single-stream Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection becomes realistic at a low-complexity. Furthermore, we propose a Differential STSK (DSTSK) scheme, assisted by the Cayley unitary transform, which does not require any Channel State Information (CSI) at the receiver. {Here, the usual error-doubling, caused by the differential decoding, gives rise to 3-dB performance penalty in comparison to Coherent STSK (CSTSK).} Additionally, we introduce an enhanced CSTSK scheme, which avoids the requirement of Inter-Antenna Synchronization (IAS) between the RF chains associated with the transmit {Antenna Elements (AEs)} by imposing a certain constraint on the dispersion matrix design{, where each column of the dispersion matrices includes only a single non-zero component}. Moreover, according to the turbo-coding principle, the proposed CSTSK and DSTSK schemes are combined with multiple serially concatenated codes and an iterative bit-to-symbol soft-demapper{. More specifically,} the associated STSK parameters are optimized with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts{, for the sake of achieving a near-capacity performance}.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2010.093010.090730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599264","Diversity and multiplexing tradeoff;space-time coding;spatial modulation;linear dispersion code;maximum likelihood detection;multiple antenna array;non-coherent detection","Dispersion;Complexity theory;Fading;Transmitting antennas;Modulation;MIMO;Receivers","","232","2","23","IEEE","11 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The quality of the resulting depth maps means that a convincing global scene model can be obtained simply by placing them side by side and removing overlapping regions.

While SIFT is known to be a strong, but computationally expensive feature descriptor, Ferns classification is fast, but requires large amounts of memory. This renders both original designs unsuitable for mobile phones. We give detailed descriptions on how we modified both approaches to make them suitable for mobile phones.

Within a prescribed delay tolerance level, each node does not need to send the data immediately as it becomes available. Instead, the node can store the data temporarily and transmit it when the mobile sink is at the most favorable location for achieving the longest WSN lifetime. To find the best solution within the proposed framework, we formulate optimization problems that maximize the lifetime of the WSN subject to the delay bound constraints, node energy constraints, and flow conservation constraints. We conduct extensive computational experiments on the optimization problems and find that the lifetime can be increased significantly as compared to not only the stationary sink model but also more traditional mobile sink models. We also show that the delay tolerance level does not affect the maximum lifetime of the WSN.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2010.76","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456364","Wireless sensor network;lifetime maximization;linear programming;delay-tolerant applications;mobile sink.","Wireless sensor networks;Delay;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Mobile robots;Disruption tolerant networking;Mobile communication;Batteries;Constraint optimization","","231","","21","IEEE","29 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A variance stabilization transform is first applied to the image-data to remove the dependence between the mean and variance of intensity values. This preprocessing requires the knowledge of parameters related to the acquisition system, also estimated in our approach. In a second step, we propose an original statistical patch-based framework for noise reduction and preservation of space-time discontinuities. In our study, discontinuities are related to small moving spots with high velocity observed in fluorescence video-microscopy. The idea is to minimize an objective nonlocal energy functional involving spatio-temporal image patches. The minimizer has a simple form and is defined as the weighted average of input data taken in spatially-varying neighborhoods. The size of each neighborhood is optimized to improve the performance of the pointwise estimator. The performance of the algorithm (which requires no motion estimation) is then evaluated on both synthetic and real image sequences using qualitative and quantitative criteria.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2009.2033991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313961","Adaptive estimation;energy minimization;fluorescence;image sequence denoising;patch-based approach;Poisson noise;variance stabilization;video-microscopy","Noise reduction;Fluorescence;Microscopy;Image sequences;Signal to noise ratio;Protein engineering;Mathematics;Deconvolution;Additive noise;Motion estimation","Algorithms;HeLa Cells;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Microscopy, Video;Normal Distribution;Poisson Distribution","231","","67","IEEE","6 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Changing trends in system frequency behavior of a power system following the loss of the largest generator are studied in detail here, using simplified frequency control models and extensive simulations of wind penetration scenarios over an extended multiyear timeframe. The system frequency response is characterized by the rate of change of frequency and the frequency nadir.

For simplicity, it is assumed that all mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with a single antenna each, and there is one active MS in each cell at one time. Accordingly, the system of interests can be modeled by a multiple-input single-output (MISO) Gaussian interference channel (IC), termed as MISO-IC, with interference treated as noise. We propose a new method to characterize different rate-tuples for active MSs on the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region for the MISO-IC, by exploring the relationship between the MISO-IC and the cognitive radio (CR) MISO channel. We show that each Pareto-boundary rate-tuple of the MISO-IC can be achieved in a decentralized manner when each of the BSs attains its own channel capacity subject to a certain set of interference-power constraints (also known as interference-temperature constraints in the CR system) at the other MS receivers. Furthermore, we show that this result leads to a new decentralized algorithm for implementing the multi-cell cooperative downlink beamforming.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2056685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504193","Beamforming;cooperative multi-cell system;interference channel;multi-antenna;Pareto optimal;rate region","Array signal processing;Downlink;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit noise;Chromium;Interference constraints;Base stations;Transmitting antennas;Design optimization;System performance","","230","3","22","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We chose a network-robot system approach, where a single robot's poor sensing capability and knowledge are supplemented by ubiquitous sensors and a human operator. The developed robot system detects a person with floor sensors to initiate interaction, identifies individuals with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, gives shopping information while chatting, and provides route guidance with deictic gestures. The robot was partially teleoperated to avoid the difficulty of speech recognition as well as to furnish a new kind of knowledge that only humans can flexibly provide. The information supplied by a human operator was later used to increase the robot's autonomy. For 25 days in a shopping mall, we conducted a field trial and gathered 2642 interactions. A total of 235 participants signed up to use RFID tags and, later, provided questionnaire responses.

The proposed algorithm is based on well-established machine learning and numerical analysis techniques, without making any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is capable of processing many thousands of features within minutes on a personal computer while maintaining a very high accuracy that is nearly insensitive to a growing number of irrelevant features.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel highly distinctive local feature descriptor named partial intensity invariant feature descriptor (PIIFD) and describe a robust automatic retinal image registration framework named Harris-PIIFD. PIIFD is invariant to image rotation, partially invariant to image intensity, affine transformation, and viewpoint/perspective change. Our Harris-PIIFD framework consists of four steps. First, corner points are used as control point candidates instead of bifurcations since corner points are sufficient and uniformly distributed across the image domain. Second, PIIFDs are extracted for all corner points, and a bilateral matching technique is applied to identify corresponding PIIFDs matches between image pairs. Third, incorrect matches are removed and inaccurate matches are refined. Finally, an adaptive transformation is used to register the image pairs. PIIFD is so distinctive that it can be correctly identified even in nonvascular areas. When tested on 168 pairs of multimodal retinal images, the Harris-PIIFD far outperforms existing algorithms in terms of robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2010.2042169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416285","Harris detector;local feature;multimodal registration;partial intensity invariance;retinal images","Retina;Image registration;Bifurcation;Automation;Biomedical engineering;Robustness;Content addressable storage;Laboratories;Degenerative diseases;Automatic control","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Retina;Retina;Retinal Vessels;Retinal Vessels","229","1","60","IEEE","18 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It displays the time and FRFD-frequency information jointly in the short-time fractional Fourier domain (STFRFD). Two aspects of its performance are considered: the 2-D resolution and the STFRFD support. The time-FRFD-bandwidth product (TFBP) is defined to measure the resolvable area and the STFRFD support. The optimal STFRFT is obtained with the criteria that maximize the 2-D resolution and minimize the STFRFD support. Its inverse transform, properties and computational complexity are presented.

The devices in the 2.4-GHz ISM band can be routinely produced with optical lithography, high-resolution radar systems can be built up using highly sophisticated, but low-cost RF-chips, and the Internet is available for global access to the tag databases. The ""Internet of Things,"" or I-o-T, will demand trillions of cheap tags and sensors. The SAW tags can overcome semiconductor-based analogs in many aspects: they can be read at a distance of a few meters with readers radiating power levels 2 to 3 orders lower, they are cheap, and they can operate in robust environments. Passive SAW tags are easily combined with sensors. Even the ""anti-collision"" problem (i.e., the simultaneous reading of many nearby tags) has adequate solutions for many practical applications. In this paper, we discuss the state-of-the-art in the development of SAW tags. The design approaches will be reviewed and optimal tag designs, as well as encoding methods, will be demonstrated. We discuss ways to reduce the size and cost of these devices. A few practical examples of tags using a timeposition coding with 106 different codes will be demonstrated. Phase-coded devices can additionally increase the number of codes at the expense of a reduction of reading distance. We also discuss new and exciting perspectives of using ultra wide band (UWB) technology for SAW-tag systems. The wide frequency band available for this standard provides a great opportunity for SAW tags to be radically reduced in size to about 1 x 1 mm2 while keeping a practically infinite number of possible different codes. Finally, the reader technology will be discussed, as well as detailed comparison made between SAW tags and IC-based semiconductor device.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422510","","Surface acoustic waves;RFID tags;Laser radar;Internet;Optical devices;Optical sensors;Lithography;Databases;Robustness;Encoding","","229","3","44","IEEE","4 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model evolution approach has also been extended to deal with many cells concurrently. Notwithstanding its high potential, the multiple-level-set method suffers from a number of shortcomings, which limit its applicability to a larger variety of cell biological imaging studies.

Landslide locations in the study area were identified by interpreting aerial photographs and satellite images, supported by extensive field surveys. Landsat TM satellite imagery was used to map the vegetation index. Maps of the topography, lineaments, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land cover were constructed from the spatial data sets. Eight landslide conditioning factors such as altitude, slope gradient, curvature, distance from the drainage, distance from the road, lithology, distance from the faults, and NDVI were extracted from the spatial database. These factors were analyzed using a neuro-fuzzy model adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. During the model development works, a total of five landslide susceptibility models were constructed. For verification, the results of the analyses were then compared with the field-verified landslide locations. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curves for all landslide susceptibility models were drawn, and the area under curve values were calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate the results of the landslide susceptibility map, and the verification results showed a 97% accuracy for model 5, employing all parameters produced in the present study as the landslide conditioning factors. The validation results showed a sufficient agreement between the obtained susceptibility map and the existing data on the landslide areas.

Quadrature passive mixers are shown to present the impedance of their baseband port to the RF port and vice versa. This transparency property, in combination with resistive feedback differential amplifiers, and “complex” feedback between the I and Q paths, can be used to control the impedance at the RF port. This impedance can be tuned using only baseband components (i.e., resistors). The noise limits of such an architecture are analyzed and simulated, and are shown to be comparable to standard RF-LNA-first receivers. Accounting for the higher harmonics of the LO frequency proves critical in accurately analyzing the behavior of these circuits and their ability to provide an impedance match with low noise figure.

In some practical applications, the signals received by an array are the mixture of near-field and far-field sources, such as speaker localization using microphone arrays and guidance (homing) systems. To localize mixed near-field and far-field sources, this paper develops a two-stage MUSIC algorithm using cumulant. The key points of this paper are: (i) in the first stage, this paper derives one special cumulant matrix, in which the virtual ¿steering vector¿ is the function of the common electric angle in both near-field and far-field signal models so that source direction-of-arrival (DOA) (near-field or far-field one) can be obtained from this electric angle using the conventional high-resolution MUSIC algorithm; (ii) in the second stage, this paper derives another particular cumulant matrix, in which the virtual ¿steering matrix¿ has full column rank no matter whether the received signals are multiple near-field sources or multiple far-field ones or their mixture. What is more important, the virtual ¿steering vector¿ can be separated into two parts, in which the first one is the function of the common electric angle in both signal models, whereas the second part is the function of the electric angle that exists only in near-field signal model. Furthermore, by substituting the common electric angle estimated in the first stage into one special Hermitian matrix formed from another MUSIC spectral function, the range of near-field sources can be obtained from the eigenvector of the Hermitian matrix. The resultant algorithm avoids two- dimensional search and pairing parameters; in addition, it avoids the estimation failure problem and alleviates aperture loss. Simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed method.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2009.2029723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200332","Array signal processing;cumulant;far-field;near-field","Multiple signal classification;Microphone arrays;Signal processing algorithms;Array signal processing;Matrices;Apertures;Automation;Direction of arrival estimation;Radar signal processing;Radar applications","","228","","28","IEEE","11 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several approaches have been developed to recover the unknown sparse vectors from the given observations, including thresholding, simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP), and convex relaxation based on a mixed matrix norm. Typically, worst case analysis is carried out in order to analyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly sparse set of vectors. However, such an approach is not able to provide insights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse reconstruction methods to each channel individually. Previous work considered an average case analysis of thresholding and SOMP by imposing a probability model on the measured signals. Here, the main focus is on analysis of convex relaxation techniques. In particular, the mixed l 2,1 approach to multichannel recovery is investigated. Under a very mild condition on the sparsity and on the dictionary characteristics, measured for example by the coherence, it is shown that the probability of recovery failure decays exponentially in the number of channels. This demonstrates that most of the time, multichannel sparse recovery is indeed superior to single channel methods. The probability bounds are valid and meaningful even for a small number of signals. Using the tools developed to analyze the convex relaxation technique, also previous bounds for thresholding and SOMP recovery are tightened.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2009.2034789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361489","Average performance;mixed-norm optimization;multichannel sparse recovery;simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit;thresholding","Matching pursuit algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Sparse matrices;Algorithm design and analysis;Radar signal processing;Mathematics;Vectors;Reconstruction algorithms;Signal analysis;Dictionaries","","228","","49","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One cost-efficient way to meet these requirements is the time-triggered communication paradigm which plans the transmission points in time of the frames off-line. This plan prevents contentions of frames on the network and is called a time-triggered schedule (tt-schedule). In general the tt-scheduling is a bin-packing problem, known to be NP-complete, where the complexity is mostly driven by the freedom in topology of the network, its associated hardware restrictions, and application-imposed constraints. Multi-hop networks, in particular, require the synthesis of path-dependent tt-schedules to maintain full determinism of time-triggered communication from sender to receiver. Our experiments using the YICES SMT solver show that the scheduling problem can be solved by YICES out-of-the-box for a few hundred random frame instances on the network. A customized tt-scheduler using YICES as a back-end solver allows to increase this number of frame instances up to tens of thousands. In terms of scheduling quality, the synthesis produces up to ninety percent maximum utilization on a communication link with schedule synthesis times of about half an hour for the biggest examples we have studied. As a nice side-effect the YICES out-of-the-box approach is immediately applicable for the verification of existing (even large-scale) tt-schedules and for debugging more sophisticated tt-schedulers.","1052-8725","978-0-7695-4298-0","10.1109/RTSS.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702246","static scheduling;SMT solver;YICES;time-triggered communication;multi-hop networks;real-time communication","Schedules;Job shop scheduling;Receivers;Synchronization;Network topology;Context;Real time systems","","227","4","22","IEEE","28 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different heuristic optimization methods have been proposed to solve this problem in previous study. In this paper, quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is proposed, which has stronger search ability and quicker convergence speed, not only because of the introduction of quantum computing theory, but also due to two special implementations: self-adaptive probability selection and chaotic sequences mutation. The proposed approach is tested with five standard benchmark functions and three power system cases consisting of 3, 13, and 40 thermal units. Comparisons with similar approaches including the evolutionary programming (EP), genetic algorithm (GA), immune algorithm (IA), and other versions of particle swarm optimization (PSO) are given.

In such a case, one of the most widely used maintenance policies is a selective maintenance in which a subset of feasible maintenance actions is chosen to be performed with the aim at achieving the subsequent mission success under limited maintenance resources. Traditional selective maintenance optimization reported in the literature only focuses on binary state systems. Most systems in industrial applications, however, have more than two states in the deterioration process. In this work, a selective maintenance policy for multi-state systems (MSS) consisting of binary state elements is investigated. Taking the imperfect maintenance quality into consideration, the Kijima model is reviewed, and a cost-maintenance quality relationship which considers the age reduction factor as a function in terms of maintenance cost is established. Moreover, with the assistance of the universal generating function (UGF) method, the probability of the repaired MSS successfully completing the subsequent mission is formulated. In place of enumerative methods, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the complicated optimization problem where both multi-state systems, and imperfect maintenance models are taken into account. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via a case study of a power station coal transportation system.

Three PV strings are cascaded together in parallel configuration and connected to a five-level inverter to produce output voltage in five levels: zero, +1/2V dc, V dc, -1/2V dc, and -V dc. Two reference signals that were identical to each other with an offset that was equivalent to the amplitude of the triangular carrier signal were used to generate PWM signals for the switches. DSP TMS320F2812 is used to implement this PWM switching scheme together with a digital proportional-integral current control algorithm. The inverter offers much less total harmonic distortion and can operate at near-unity power factor. The validity of the proposed inverter is verified through simulation and implemented in a prototype.

Owing to a rigid structure and the absence of magnetic source on the rotor, a switched reluctance machine (SRM) is inherently robust and cost effective. In spite of these advantages, several challenges in the control of this machine remain an issue, including high levels of torque ripple, acoustic noise, and a relatively low torque density. This paper presents a new family of SRMs which have higher number of rotor poles than stator poles. Using a newly defined pole design formula, several novel combinations of the stator-rotor poles have been proposed. From the simulation and experimental analysis of a prototype 6/10 configuration, it has been observed that this machine produces higher torque per unit volume and comparable torque ripple when compared to a conventional 6/4 SRM with similar number of phases and constraints in volume. The results presented in this paper make this family of machines a strong contender for survivable high-performance applications for automotive propulsion systems. The simulation and experimental results for the prototype 6/10 configuration have been presented and compared to a conventional 6/4 design for verification.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2009.2034678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290140","High torque density;low cost;low torque ripple;propulsion;switched reluctance machine (SRM)","Reluctance machines;Stators;Reluctance motors;Rotors;Propulsion;Virtual prototyping;Torque;Motor drives;Hybrid electric vehicles;Magnetic switching","","226","4","41","IEEE","20 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When a MIMO radar transmits orthogonal waveforms, the reflected signals from scatterers are linearly independent of each other. Therefore, adaptive receive filters, such as Capon and amplitude and phase estimation (APES) filters, can be directly employed in MIMO radar applications. High levels of noise and strong clutter, however, significantly worsen detection performance of the data-dependent beamformers due to a shortage of snapshots. The iterative adaptive approach (IAA), a nonparametric and user parameter-free weighted least-squares algorithm, was recently shown to offer improved resolution and interference rejection performance in several passive and active sensing applications. In this paper, we show how IAA can be extended to MIMO radar imaging, in both the negligible and nonnegligible intrapulse Doppler cases, and we also establish some theoretical convergence properties of IAA. In addition, we propose a regularized IAA algorithm, referred to as IAA-R, which can perform better than IAA by accounting for unrepresented additive noise terms in the signal model. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of MIMO radar over single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar, and further highlight the improved performance achieved with the proposed IAA-R method for target imaging.

We present smart energy control strategies based on quadratic programming for charging PHEVs, aiming to minimize the peak load and flatten the overall load profile. We compare two strategies, and benchmark them against a business-as-usual scenario assuming full charging starting upon plugging in the PHEV. The first, local strategy only uses information at the home where the PHEV is charged: as a result the charging is optimized for local loads. The local strategy is compared to a global iterative strategy which controls the charging of multiple vehicles based on global load information over a residential area. Both strategies control the duration and rate of charging and result in charging schedules for each vehicle. We present quantitative simulation results over a set of 150 homes, and discuss the strategies in terms of complexity and performance (esp. resulting energy consumption), as well as their requirements concerning infrastructure and communication.","","978-1-4244-6039-7","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486561","","Hybrid electric vehicles;Power grids;Automatic control;Intelligent vehicles;Energy consumption;Communication system control;Smart grids;Process control;Information technology;Quadratic programming","","226","3","9","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The TDDS relies on small-area metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) where recovery proceeds in discrete steps. Contrary to techniques for the analysis of random telegraph noise (RTN), which only allow to monitor the defect behavior in a rather narrow window, the TDDS can be used to study the capture and emission times of the defects over an extremely wide range. We demonstrate that the recoverable component of NBTI is due to thermally activated hole capture and emission in individual defects with a very wide distribution of time constants, consistent with nonradiative multiphonon theory previously applied to the analysis of RTN. The defects responsible for this process show a number of peculiar features similar to anomalous RTN previously observed in nMOS transistors. A quantitative model is suggested which can explain the bias as well as the temperature dependence of the characteristic time constants. Furthermore, it is shown how the new model naturally explains the various abnormalities observed.","1938-1891","978-1-4244-5429-7","10.1109/IRPS.2010.5488859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488859","","Spectroscopy;Temperature dependence;MOSFETs;Temperature distribution;Stress;FETs;Telegraphy;Monitoring;Niobium compounds;Titanium compounds","","225","","44","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, we present a novel method to determine the shape of the platform formation to minimize error in the estimates and design a cooperative formation control law to asymptotically achieve the optimal formation shape. Third, we use the cooperative filter estimates in a provably convergent motion control law that drives the center of the platform formation to move along level curves of the field.

Furthermore, 3.8 million deaths are attributable to diabetes complications each year. It has been shown that 80% of type 2 diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed by early identification of people at risk. In this context, several data mining and machine learning methods have been used for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. In this paper, we propose utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the diagnosis of diabetes. In particular, we use an additional explanation module, which turns the “black box” model of an SVM into an intelligible representation of the SVM's diagnostic (classification) decision. Results on a real-life diabetes dataset show that intelligible SVMs provide a promising tool for the prediction of diabetes, where a comprehensible ruleset have been generated, with prediction accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 94%. Furthermore, the extracted rules are medically sound and agree with the outcome of relevant medical studies.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2009.2039485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5378519","Data mining;diabetes;machine learning;medical diagnosis","Support vector machines;Diabetes;Support vector machine classification;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Public healthcare;Delay;Data mining;Learning systems;Accuracy","Diabetes Mellitus;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval","224","1","35","IEEE","12 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both noncooperative and cooperative schemes are considered. We start with the noncooperative RSS-based localization problem and derive a nonconvex estimator that approximates the ML estimator but has no logarithm in the residual. Next, we apply the semidefinite relaxation technique to the derived nonconvex estimator and develop a convex estimator. To further improve the estimation performance, we append the ML estimator to the convex estimator with the result by the convex estimator as the initial point. We then extend these techniques to the cooperative localization problem. The corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are derived as performance benchmarks.

When determining distance distributions in random networks, the underlying nodal arrangement is almost universally taken to be a stationary Poisson point process. While this may be a good approximation in some cases, there are also certain shortcomings to this model, such as the fact that, in practical networks, the number of nodes in disjoint areas is not independent. This paper considers a more-realistic network model where a known and fixed number of nodes are independently distributed in a given region and characterizes the distribution of the Euclidean internode distances. The key finding is that, when the nodes are uniformly randomly placed inside a ball of arbitrary dimensions, the probability density function (pdf) of the internode distances follows a generalized beta distribution. This result is applied to study wireless network characteristics such as energy consumption, interference, outage, and connectivity.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2035044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299075","Binomial point process;interference;internode distances;outage;Poisson point process;wireless networks","Wireless networks;Interference;Performance analysis;Scattering;Information processing;Intelligent networks;Wireless application protocol;Probability density function;Energy consumption;Large-scale systems","","223","","17","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed control algorithm exploits the potential of sinusoidal domain proportional+multiresonant controller (in the inner voltage regulation loop) to make the system suitable for nonlinear and unbalanced loads with a simple and generalized structure of virtual output-impedance loop. The decentralized operation is achieved by using three-phase $P/Q$ droop characteristics. The overall control algorithm helps to limit the harmonic contents and the degree of unbalance in the output-voltage waveform and to achieve excellent power-sharing accuracy in spite of mismatch in the inverter output impedances. Moreover, a synchronized turn on with consequent change over to the droop mode is applied for the new incoming unit in order to limit the circulating current completely. The simulation and experimental results from -1 kVA and -0.5 kVA paralleled units validate the effectiveness of the scheme.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2010.2068313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551218","Microgrid;output impedance;proportional+ multiresonant controller;start-up phase-locked loop (PLL);wireless control","Inverters;Impedance;Voltage control;Phase locked loops;Wire;Reactive power;Converters","","223","","28","IEEE","19 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most pressing challenge in such safety-driven communication is to maintain acceptable tracking accuracy while avoiding congestion in the shared channel. In this article we propose a transmission control protocol that adapts communication rate and power based on the dynamics of a vehicular network and safety-driven tracking process. The proposed solution uses a closed-loop control concept and accounts for wireless channel unreliability. Simulation results confirm that if packet generation rate and associated transmission power for safety messages are adjusted in an on-demand and adaptive fashion, robust tracking is possible under various traffic conditions.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2010.5395777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395777","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Communication system control;Control systems;Vehicle safety;Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Pressing;Protocols;Vehicle dynamics","","222","10","10","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Following the philosophy of design for user, we propose a Social Selfishness Aware Routing (SSAR) algorithm to allow user selfishness and provide better routing performance in an efficient way. To select a forwarding node, SSAR considers both users' willingness to forward and their contact opportunity, resulting in a better forwarding strategy than purely contact-based approaches. Moreover, SSAR formulates the data forwarding process as a Multiple Knapsack Problem with Assignment Restrictions (MKPAR) to satisfy user demands for selfishness and performance. Trace-driven simulations show that SSAR allows users to maintain selfishness and achieves better routing performance with low transmission cost.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5838-7","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462138","","Routing;Disruption tolerant networking;Peer to peer computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Relays;Communications Society;Computer science;Costs;Wireless networks;Packet switching","","221","","30","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enable driver-assistance systems to address these problems, we require new sensing approaches to infer a driver's focus of attention. In this paper, we present a new procedure for static head-pose estimation and a new algorithm for visual 3-D tracking. They are integrated into the novel real-time (30 fps) system for measuring the position and orientation of a driver's head. This system consists of three interconnected modules that detect the driver's head, provide initial estimates of the head's pose, and continuously track its position and orientation in six degrees of freedom. The head-detection module consists of an array of Haar-wavelet Adaboost cascades. The initial pose estimation module employs localized gradient orientation (LGO) histograms as input to support vector regressors (SVRs). The tracking module provides a fine estimate of the 3-D motion of the head using a new appearance-based particle filter for 3-D model tracking in an augmented reality environment. We describe our implementation that utilizes OpenGL-optimized graphics hardware to efficiently compute particle samples in real time. To demonstrate the suitability of this system for real driving situations, we provide a comprehensive evaluation with drivers of varying ages, race, and sex spanning daytime and nighttime conditions.

We make the optimally tuned implementations available at sparselab.stanford.edu; they run “out of the box” with no user tuning: it is not necessary to select thresholds or know the likely degree of sparsity. Our class of algorithms includes iterative hard and soft thresholding with or without relaxation, as well as CoSaMP, subspace pursuit and some natural extensions. As a result, our optimally tuned algorithms dominate such proposals. Our notion of optimality is defined in terms of phase transitions, i.e., we maximize the number of nonzeros at which the algorithm can successfully operate. We show that the phase transition is a well-defined quantity with our suite of random underdetermined linear systems. Our tuning gives the highest transition possible within each class of algorithms. We verify by extensive computation the robustness of our recommendations to the amplitude distribution of the nonzero coefficients as well as the matrix ensemble defining the underdetermined system. Our findings include the following. 1) For all algorithms, the worst amplitude distribution for nonzeros is generally the constant-amplitude random-sign distribution, where all nonzeros are the same amplitude. 2) Various random matrix ensembles give the same phase transitions; random partial isometries may give different transitions and require different tuning. 3) Optimally tuned subspace pursuit dominates optimally tuned CoSaMP, particularly so when the system is almost square.

Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems are used to approximate the unknown system functions. A novel adaptive-control scheme is developed on the basis of the so-called “dynamic-surface control” and “minimal-learning parameters” techniques. The proposed scheme has following two key features. First, the number of parameters updated online for each subsystem is reduced to one, and both problems of “curse of dimension” for high-dimensional systems and “explosion of complexity” inherent in the conventional backstepping methods are circumvented. Second, the potential controller-singularity problem in some of the existing adaptive-control schemes with feedback-linearization techniques is overcome. It is shown via Lyapunov theory that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results via two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme.

Here, we demonstrate that signals routinely recorded by Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers installed to measure crustal deformation for geophysical studies could be used to provide a global network of soil moisture sensors. The sensitivity to soil moisture is seen in reflected GPS signals, which are quantified by using the GPS signal to noise ratio data. We show that these data are sensitive to soil moisture variations for areas of 1000 m2 horizontally and 1-6 cm vertically. It is demonstrated that GPS signals penetrate deeper when the soil is dry than when it is wet. This change in penetration or ¿reflector¿ depth, along with the change in dielectric constant, causes the GPS signal strength to change its frequency and amplitude. Comparisons with conventional water content reflectometer sensors show good agreement (r2=0.9 to 0.76) with the variation in frequencies of the reflected GPS signals over a period of 7 months, with most of the disagreement occurring when soil moisture content is less than 0.1 cm3/cm3.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2033612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5325890","Global positioning system;remote sensing;soil measurements","Global Positioning System;Satellites;Soil moisture;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers;Antennas","","221","","26","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples of the latter case include total variation denoising, compressed sensing, fault detection, and image classification. In both scenarios, the optimization is carried out on time scales of seconds or minutes and without strict time constraints. Convex optimization has traditionally been considered computationally expensive, so its use has been limited to applications where plenty of time is available. Such restrictions are no longer justified. The combination of dramatically increased computing power, modern algorithms, and new coding approaches has delivered an enormous speed increase, which makes it possible to solve modest-sized convex optimization problems on microsecond or millisecond time scales and with strict deadlines.

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) SAR end-to-end simulator (SETES) was used in conjunction with airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) data to estimate regions of the image in which water would not be visible due to shadow or layover caused by buildings and taller vegetation.

Of the urban water pixels that are visible to TerraSAR-X, 76% were correctly detected, with an associated false positive rate of 25%. If all the urban water pixels were considered, including those in shadow and layover regions, these figures fell to 58% and 19%, respectively. The algorithm is aimed at producing urban flood extents with which to calibrate and validate urban flood inundation models, and these findings indicate that TerraSAR-X is capable of providing useful data for this purpose.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2029236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280350","Algorithms;hydrology;image processing;simulation","Floods;Urban areas;Surface topography;Surface treatment;Hazards;Laser radar;Vegetation;Associate members;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar detection","","218","","40","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, two kernel-view extensions of this method are provided to handle the situations where descriptors and similarity functions are in the form of kernel matrices. We then investigate into two applications of our algorithm to feature combination: 1) fusing gray-level and LBP features for face recognition, and 2) combining multiple kernels for object categorization.

However, traditional fuzz testing tools have a well-known common drawback: they are ineffective if most generated malformed inputs are rejected in the early stage of program running, especially when target programs employ checksum mechanisms to verify the integrity of inputs. In this paper, we present TaintScope, an automatic fuzzing system using dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution techniques, to tackle the above problem. TaintScope has several novel contributions: 1) TaintScope is the first checksum-aware fuzzing tool to the best of our knowledge. It can identify checksum fields in input instances, accurately locate checksum-based integrity checks by using branch profiling techniques, and bypass such checks via control flow alteration. 2) TaintScope is a directed fuzzing tool working at X86 binary level (on both Linux and Window). Based on fine-grained dynamic taint tracing, TaintScope identifies which bytes in a well-formed input are used in security-sensitive operations (e.g., invoking system/library calls) and then focuses on modifying such bytes. Thus, generated inputs are more likely to trigger potential vulnerabilities. 3) TaintScope is fully automatic, from detecting checksum, directed fuzzing, to repairing crashed samples. It can fix checksum values in generated inputs using combined concrete and symbolic execution techniques. We evaluate TaintScope on a number of large real-world applications. Experimental results show that TaintScope can accurately locate the checksum checks in programs and dramatically improve the effectiveness of fuzz testing. TaintScope has already found 27 previously unknown vulnerabilities in several widely used applications, including Adobe Acrobat, Google Picasa, Microsoft Paint, and ImageMagick. Most of these severe vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Secunia and oCERT, and assigned CVE identifiers (such as CVE-2009-1882, CVE-2009-2688). Corresponding patches from vendors are released or in progress based on our reports.","2375-1207","978-1-4244-6895-9","10.1109/SP.2010.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504701","fuzzing;dynamic taint analysis;symbolic execution","Software tools;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Registers;Assembly;Digital signal processing;Digital signal processing chips;Telecommunication control;Large scale integration;Logic","","218","7","68","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To cope with high complexity, increasing memory requirements, and lack of tracking capability that batch Lasso estimators face when processing observations sequentially, the present paper develops a novel time-weighted Lasso (TWL) approach. Performance analysis reveals that TWL cannot estimate consistently the desired signal support without compromising rate of convergence. This motivates the development of a time- and norm-weighted Lasso (TNWL) scheme with ℓ1-norm weights obtained from the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The resultant algorithm consistently estimates the support of sparse signals without reducing the convergence rate. To cope with sparsity-aware recursive real-time processing, novel adaptive algorithms are also developed to enable online coordinate descent solvers of TWL and TNWL that provably converge to the true sparse signal in the time-invariant case. Simulated tests compare competing alternatives and corroborate the performance of the novel algorithms in estimating time-invariant signals, and tracking time-varying signals under sparsity constraints.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2010.2046897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439789","Adaptive algorithms;compressive sampling;coordinate descent;RLS;sparse linear regression","Adaptive estimation;Resonance light scattering;Linear regression;Signal processing algorithms;Convergence;Collaborative work;Government;Acoustic signal processing;Input variables;Image coding","","218","1","30","IEEE","29 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, so far the stability analysis of multi-inverter systems has always been performed in a computationally intensive manner by considering the entire microgrid. In a practical microgrid, where the number of inverters may be large or the capacity of the units may differ, it becomes essential to develop a method by which stability can be examined without much computational burden. The system of differential algebraic equations has been simplified using justifiable assumptions to result in a final expression that allows the stability of the microgrid to be examined separately with respect to the droop control laws of each inverter transformed into an equivalent network. Moreover, the procedure allows taking into consideration the R/X ratio of the interconnecting cables. Analysis of final expressions validate the stability results reported in literature.

Since CCA and M-CCA are based on second-order statistics they provide a relatively lessstrained solution as compared to methods based on higherorder statistics such as ICA. While this can be advantageous, the flexibility also tends to lead to solutions that are less sparse than those obtained using assumptions of non-Gaussianity-in particular superGaussianity-at times making the results more difficult to interpret.

In this paper, we propose an automated, two-stage PPG data processing method to minimize the effects of motion artifacts. The technique is based on our prior work related to motion artifact detection (stage 1) [R. Krishnan, B. Natarajan, and S. Warren, ``Analysis and detection of motion artifacts in photoplethysmographic data using higher order statistics,'' in Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process. (ICASSP 2008), Las Vegas, Nevada, Apr. 2008, pp. 613-616] and motion artifact reduction (stage 2) [R. Krishnan, B. Natarajan, and S. Warren, ``Motion artifact reduction in photoplethysmography using magnitude-based frequency domain independent component analysis,'' in Proc. 17th Int. Conf. Comput. Commun. Network, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Aug. 2008, pp. 1-5]. Regarding stage 1, we present novel and consistent techniques to detect the presence of motion artifact in PPGs given higher order statistical information present in the data. We analyze these data in the time and frequency domains (FDs) and identify metrics to distinguish between clean and motion-corrupted data. A Neyman-Pearson detection rule is formulated for each of the metrics. Furthermore, by treating each of the metrics as observations from independent sensors, we employ hard fusion and soft fusion techniques presented in [Z. Chair and P. Varshney, ``Optimal data fusion in multiple sensor detection systems,'' IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst., AES, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 98-101, Jan. 1986] and [C. C. Lee and J. J. Chao, ``Optimum local decision space partitioning for distributed detection,'' IEEE Trans. Aerosp. Electron. Syst., AES, vol. 25, no. 7, pp. 536-544, Jul. 1989], respectively, in order to fuse individual decisions into a global system decision. For stage two, we propose a motion artifact reduction method that is effective even in the presence of severe subject movement. The approach involves an enhanced preprocessing unit consisting of a motion detection unit (MDU, developed in this paper), period estimation unit, and Fourier series reconstruction unit. The MDU identifies clean data frames versus those corrupted with motion artifacts. The period estimation unit determines the fundamental frequency of a corrupt frame. The Fourier series reconstruction unit reconstructs the final preprocessed signal by utilizing the spectrum variability of the pulse waveform. Preprocessed data are then fed to a magnitude-based FD independent component analysis unit. This helps reduce motion artifacts present at the frequencies of the reconstruction components. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the overall motion artifact reduction method.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2039568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415601","Higher order statistics (HOS);independent component analysis (ICA);magnitude-based frequency-domain ICA (FD-ICA);motion artifact;motion detection unit (MDU);photoplethysmogram (PPG)","Motion detection;Motion analysis;Acoustic signal detection;Frequency domain analysis;Independent component analysis;Sensor fusion;Electrons;Fourier series;Frequency estimation;Monitoring","Adult;Algorithms;Artifacts;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Female;Forearm;Fourier Analysis;Humans;Male;Movement;Normal Distribution;Photoplethysmography;ROC Curve;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","216","8","27","IEEE","17 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2035920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356190","Atrial fibrillation (AF);blind source separation (BSS);independent component analysis (ICA);iterative optimization;kurtosis;optimal step size;performance analysis","Robustness;Independent component analysis;Polynomials;Data mining;Iterative algorithms;Costs;Convergence;Computational efficiency;Numerical analysis;Atrial fibrillation","Algorithms;Atrial Fibrillation;Atrial Fibrillation;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Atria;Humans;Models, Statistical;Normal Distribution;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telecommunications;Time Factors","216","1","67","IEEE","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in this paper, we try to apply principal components analysis (PCA) to feature selection. The proposed method well addresses the feature selection issue, from a viewpoint of numerical analysis. The analysis clearly shows that PCA has the potential to perform feature selection and is able to select a number of important individuals from all the feature components. Our method assumes that different feature components of original samples have different effects on feature extraction result and exploits the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of PCA to evaluate the significance of each feature component of the original sample. When evaluating the significance of the feature components, the proposed method takes a number of eigenvectors into account. Then it uses a reasonable scheme to perform feature selection. The devised algorithm is not only subject to the nature of PCA but also computationally efficient. The experimental results on face recognition show that when the proposed method is able to greatly reduce the dimensionality of the original samples, it also does not bring the decrease in the recognition accuracy.","","978-1-4244-8664-9","10.1109/ICSEM.2010.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640135","feature selection;principal component analysis;face recognition","Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Face;Databases;Face recognition;Transforms","","215","2","21","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel multiconcavity modeling approach is proposed to handle both healthy and unhealthy retinas simultaneously. The differentiable concavity measure is proposed to handle bright lesions in a perceptive space. The line-shape concavity measure is proposed to remove dark lesions which have an intensity structure different from the line-shaped vessels in a retina. The locally normalized concavity measure is designed to deal with unevenly distributed noise due to the spherical intensity variation in a retinal image. These concavity measures are combined together according to their statistical distributions to detect vessels in general retinal images. Very encouraging experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently yields the best performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on the abnormal retinas and its accuracy outperforms the human observer, which has not been achieved by any of the state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Most importantly, unlike existing methods, the proposed method shows very attractive performances not only on healthy retinas but also on a mixture of healthy and pathological retinas.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2043259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433078","Multiconcavity modeling;perceptive transform;regularization;retina image;retinal vessel segmentation","Retinal vessels;Retina;Lesions;Image segmentation;Blood vessels;Biomedical imaging;Extraterrestrial measurements;Noise measurement;Statistical distributions;Humans","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retinal Vessels;Retinoscopy;Sensitivity and Specificity","214","","56","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A model is designed to combine a physical model-based polarimetric decomposition with the random-volume-over-ground (RVoG) PolInSAR parameter inversion approach. The combination of a polarimetric scattering media model with a PolInSAR RVoG vertical structure model provides the possibility to separate the ground and the volume coherency matrices based on polarimetric signatures and interferometric coherence diversity. The proposed polarimetric decomposition characterizes volumetric media by the degree of polarization orientation randomness and by the particle scattering anisotropy. Using the full model enhances the estimation of the vertical forest structure parameters by enabling us to estimate the ground-to-volume ratio, the temporal decorrelation, and the differential extinction. For forest vegetation observed at L-band, this model accounts for the ground topography, forest and canopy layer heights, wave attenuation in the canopy, tree morphology in the form of the angular distribution and the effective shapes of the branches, and the contributions from the ground level consisting of surface scattering and double-bounce ground-trunk interactions, as well as volumetric understory scattering. The parameter estimation performance is evaluated on real airborne L-band SAR data of the Traunstein test site, acquired by the German Aerospace Center (DLR)'s E-SAR sensor in 2003, in both single- and multibaseline configurations. The retrieved forest height is compared with the ground-truth measurements, revealing, for the given test site, an average root-mean-square error (rmse) of about 5 m in the repeat-pass configuration. This implies an improvement in rmse by over 2 m in comparison to the pure coherence-based RVoG PolInSAR parameter inversion.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2031101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5299063","Forest structure;polarimetric decomposition;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry;temporal decorrelation","Particle scattering;Radar scattering;Aerospace testing;Vegetation;L-band;Information retrieval;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Matrix decomposition;Coherence;Random media","","213","","42","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there has not been a clear unifying theoretical analysis of their performance in terms of both noise reduction and speech distortion. To fill this gap, we analyze the frequency-domain (non-causal) multichannel linear filtering for noise reduction in this paper. For completeness, we consider the noise reduction constrained optimization problem that leads to the parameterized multichannel non-causal Wiener filter (PMWF). Our contribution is fivefold. First, we formally show that the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter is a particular case of the PMWF by properly formulating the constrained optimization problem of noise reduction. Second, we propose new simplified expressions for the PMWF, the MVDR, and the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) that depend on the signals' statistics only. In contrast to earlier works, these expressions are explicitly independent of the channel transfer function ratios. Third, we quantify the theoretical gains and losses in terms of speech distortion and noise reduction when using the PWMF by establishing new simplified closed-form expressions for three performance measures, namely, the signal distortion index, the noise reduction factor (originally proposed in the paper titled ldquoNew insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter,rdquo by J. Chen (IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, Vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 1218-1234, Jul. 2006) to analyze the single channel time-domain Wiener filter), and the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Fourth, we analyze the effects of coherent and incoherent noise in addition to the benefits of utilizing multiple microphones. Fifth, we propose a new proof for the a posteriori SNR improvement achieved by the PMWF.

A power constraint is also added to the proposed three-component decomposition. The E-SAR polarimetric data acquired over the Oberpfaffenhofen area in Germany are applied in the experiment. The results show that the pixels with negative powers are totally eliminated by the proposed decomposition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new model.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2041242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437202","Freeman decomposition;incoherent polarimetric decomposition;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Matrix decomposition;Radar scattering;Synthetic aperture radar;Covariance matrix;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Entropy;Radar polarimetry;Probability density function;Pixel","","213","","20","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Determination of Dielectric Constant of Fabric Materials and Their Use as Substrates for Design and Development of Antennas for Wearable Applications","S. Sankaralingam; B.

The technique reported here is based on the resonance method and focused on the use of microstrip patch radiator, which contains fabric material as its substrate. The accurate value of the dielectric constant of the fabric material can easily be extracted from the measured resonant frequency of the patch radiator. The dielectric constant values of six fabric materials, including jeans cotton, polyester combined cotton, and polyester, have been determined by this way. As an extended objective of this paper, initial investigations are done to study the performance/behavioral characteristics of wearable antennas in the Bluetooth industrial, scientific, and medical band. Two of the six textile antenna structures, developed to meet out the primary objective of determining the dielectric constant of fabrics, are tested, and their performance characteristics, such as impedance bandwidth, gain, efficiency, etc., are measured. In addition, another Bluetooth antenna employing polyester fabric substrate is designed considering its measured accurate value of dielectric constant and subjected to radiation pattern measurements. In general, all the measured antennas yield very good results, fulfilling the requirements for practical applications, and in particular, the third fabric antenna utilizing the accurate value of the dielectric constant determined shows superior performance characteristics compared to others, indicating the correctness of our approach. Thus, the suitability of fabric substrate materials for the development of textile antennas with microstrip patch configuration is also well demonstrated.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2010.2063090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601775","Antenna measurements;dielectric measurements;fabric substrates;rectangular microstrip wearable antenna;resonance method;textile antennas","Antenna measurements;Fabrics;Dielectric constant;Dielectric measurements;Resonant frequency;Frequency measurement","","212","","14","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

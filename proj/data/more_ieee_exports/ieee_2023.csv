"Wideband Microstrip Antenna in Small Volume Without Using Fundamental Mode","Y. Zhang; Y. Li","Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",Electromagnetic Science,"1 Sep 2023","2023","1","2","1","6","Microstrip antennas are of significant interest and extensively utilized in communication systems because of their unique low profile. However, the general difficulty in microstrip antenna design lies in its wideband electromagnetic radiation within a low-profile structure. To enhance the bandwidth, superposing the fundamental mode and other high-order modes is the most common method, but this occupies a larger footprint than regular narrow-band modes. Here, as a counterintuitive way to broaden the bandwidth, a wideband miniaturized microstrip antenna is proposed by using two high-order modes. The avoidance of the fundamental mode allows for footprint miniaturization without decreasing the bandwidth, providing a different but feasible design strategy for wideband microstrip antennas. Compared with other microstrip antennas at the same profile, the proposed antenna achieves wider bandwidth and a smaller footprint. The experimental result shows a bandwidth of 4.81-6.01 GHz is achieved with a volume of 0.47 ×0.47 × 0.043 λ03, where λ0represents the in-vacuum wavelength at the center frequency. Therefore, the proposed design provides an effective solution to the intrinsic contradiction between wideband electromagnetic radiation and compact antenna dimensions, not only in a low profile but in a small footprint, contributing to the fundamental development of microstrip antennas.","2836-8282","","10.23919/emsci.2023.0007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238368","Microstrip antennas;Wideband antennas;High-order modes;Low profile;Small footprint","Impedance measurement;Volume measurement;Metals;Microstrip antennas;Electromagnetic radiation;Distance measurement;Microstrip","","37","","23","","1 Sep 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

Otherwise, people will have difficulty choosing the film they want to watch. The process of choosing or searching for a film in a large film database is currently time-consuming and tedious. Users spend extensive time on the internet or on several movie viewing sites without success until they find a film that matches their taste. This happens especially because humans are confused about choosing things and quickly change their minds. Hence, the recommendation system becomes critical. This study aims to reduce user effort and facilitate the movie research task. Further, we used the root mean square error scale to evaluate and compare different models adopted in this paper. These models were employed with the aim of developing a classification model for predicting movies. Thus, we tested and evaluated several cooperative filtering techniques. We used four approaches to implement sparse matrix completion algorithms: $k$-nearest neighbors, matrix factorization, co-clustering, and slope-one.","2708-6240","","10.23919/ICN.2023.0024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379047","recommendation system;machine learning;collaborative filtering (CF);decision support system;big data","Filtering;Databases;Predictive models;Watches;Motion pictures;Prediction algorithms;Sparse matrices","","25","","30","","1 Jan 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
"Two Novel SMOTE Methods for Solving Imbalanced Classification Problems","Y. Bao; S.

As an effective method to deal with imbalanced classification problems, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) has its disadvantage: Some noise samples may participate in the process of synthesizing new samples; As a result, the new synthetic sample lacks its rationality, which will reduce the classification performances of the network. To remedy this shortcoming, two novel improved SMOTE method are proposed in this paper: Center point SMOTE (CP-SMOTE) method and Inner and outer SMOTE (IO-SMOTE) method. The CP-SMOTE method generates new samples based on finding several center points, then linearly combining the minority samples with their corresponding center points. The IO-SMOTE method divides minority samples into inner and outer samples, and then uses inner samples as much as possible in the subsequent process of generating new samples. Numerical experiments are conducted to prove that compared with no-sampling and conventional SMOTE methods, the CP-SMOTE and IO-SMOTE methods can achieve better classification performances.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3236794","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61720106005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016726","Imbalanced classification problems;IO-SMOTE method;CP-SMOTE method;machine learning","Cancer;Training data;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Data processing;Viruses (medical)","","24","","34","CCBY","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such tools become more accessible, students across the globe may use them to assist with their homework. However, it is still unclear whether ChatGPT’s performance is advanced enough to pose a serious risk of plagiarism. We fill this gap by evaluating ChatGPT on two introductory and two advanced university-level courses. We find that ChatGPT receives near-perfect grades on the majority of questions in the introductory courses but has not yet reached the level of sophistication required to pass in advanced courses. Moreover, adding a few full stops or typos may fool a machine learning algorithm designed to detect ChatGPT-generated text. These findings suggest that, at least for some courses, current artificial intelligence tools pose a real threat that can no longer be overlooked by educational institutions.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2023.3255599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10111520","","Ethics;Machine learning algorithms;Plagiarism;Education;Media;Chatbots;Intelligent systems;Artificial intelligence","","24","","10","CCBY","28 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An individual load forecasting model can be trained either on each consumer's own smart meter data or the smart meter data of multiple consumers. The former practice may suffer from overfitting if a complex model is trained because the dataset is limited; the latter practice cannot protect the privacy of individual consumers. This paper tackles the dilemma by proposing a personalized federated approach for individual consumer load forecasting. Specifically, a group of consumers first jointly train a federated forecasting model on the shared smart meter data pool, and then each consumer personalizes the federated forecasting model on their own data. Comprehensive case studies are conducted on an open dataset of 100 households. Results verify the proposed method can enhance forecasting accuracy by making full use of data from other consumers with privacy protection.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.07350","Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9770488","Federated learning;load forecasting;personalization;privacy-preserving;smart meter","Forecasting;Data models;Load modeling;Predictive models;Training;Collaborative work;Load forecasting","","20","","17","","6 May 2022","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

The graded-index of the lens is implemented with a periodic structure arranged in a body-centred cubic (BCC) lattice. We demonstrate that the BCC structure provides attractive properties for the design of inhomogeneous dielectric lenses. Importantly, the BCC structure can be used to alleviate the manufacturing constrains compared to conventional periodic structures. The lens is fed by a dielectric-loaded square waveguide.

Established ship monitoring systems are the automatic identification system (AIS) and marine radars. However, not all ships are committed to carry an AIS transponder and the marine radars suffer from limited visibility. For these reasons, airborne radars can be used as an additional and supportive sensor for ship monitoring, especially on the open sea. State-of-the-art algorithms for ship detection in radar imagery are based on constant false alarm rate (CFAR). Such algorithms are pixel-based and therefore it can be challenging in practice to achieve near real-time detection. This letter presents two object-oriented ship detectors based on the faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN). The first detector operates in time domain and the second detector operates in Doppler domain of airborne Range-Compressed (RC) radar data patches. The Faster R-CNN models are trained on thousands of real X-band airborne RC radar data patches containing several ship signals. The robustness of the proposed object-oriented ship detectors is tested on multiple scenarios, showing high recall performance of the models even in very dense multitarget scenarios in the complex inshore environment of the North Sea.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3229141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984160","Airborne radar;deep learning;maritime safety;moving target indication (MTI);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Marine vehicles;Radar;Detectors;Radar detection;Doppler effect;Radar imaging;Artificial intelligence","","13","","17","CCBY","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this framework, we propose a new design strategy for adding reconfigurability to reflective metasurfaces (MTSs) and, thus, implementing RISs. In particular, we exploit the insights of CV theory to control the overall scattering pattern of reflective MTSs and reduce the complexity of the control system. Indeed, instead of continuously tuning the response of each MTS element, the proposed solution requires only switching on and off the response of a portion of the MTS itself, allowing for an easier practical implementation.

This is known as the far-field approximation and is soundly justified at sub-6-GHz frequencies at most relevant transmission ranges. However, when higher frequencies and shorter transmission ranges are used, the wave curvature over the array is no longer negligible, and arrays operate in the so-called radiative near-field region. This letter aims to show that the classical far-field approximation may significantly underestimate the achievable spectral efficiency of multi-user MIMO communications operating in the 30-GHz bands and above, even at ranges beyond the Fraunhofer distance. For planar arrays with typical sizes, we show that computing combining schemes based on the far-field model significantly reduces channel gain and spatial multiplexing capability. When the radiative near-field model is used, interference rejection schemes, such as the optimal minimum mean-square-error combiner, appear to be very promising, when combined with electrically large arrays, to meet the requirements of next-generation networks.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2023.3268087","Università di Pisa(grant numbers:PRA 2022 91 INTERCONNECT); Italian Ministry of Education and Research (MUR) in the Framework of the FoReLab Project (Departments of Excellence); SSF(grant numbers:FFL18-0277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104065","near-field focusing;mm-Wave and sub-THz communications;Fraunhofer distance;spherical wavefronts","Antenna arrays;MIMO communication;Wireless communication;Noise measurement;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Planar arrays","","11","","15","CCBY","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FiQuS scripts have a modular structure to accommodate a broad range of geometries and simulation requirements, focusing mainly on superconducting accelerator magnets. At its advanced stage, the tool will be capable of 1D, 2D, and 3D geometry generation of superconducting elements such as bus bars, multi-pole, solenoid, and canted-cos-theta (CCT) magnets.

"An Improved Deadbeat Predictive Current Control of PMSM Drives Based on the Ultra-local Model","Y. Zhang; W. Shen; H. Yang","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China; School of Electrical and Control Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China; School of Electrical and Control Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China",Chinese Journal of Electrical Engineering,"5 Jul 2023","2023","9","2","27","37","Deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) has been widely applied in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives due to its fast dynamic response and good steady-state performance. However, the control accuracy of DPCC is dependent on the machine parameters' accuracy. In practical applications, the machine parameters may vary with working conditions due to temperature, saturation, skin effect, and so on. As a result, the performance of DPCC may degrade when there are parameter mismatches between the actual value and the one used in the controller. To solve the problem of parameter dependence for DPCC, this study proposes an improved model-free predictive current control method for PMSM drives. The accurate model of the PMSM is replaced by a first-order ultra-local model. This model is dynamically updated by online estimation of the gain of the input voltage and the other parts describing the system dynamics. After obtaining this ultra-local model from the information on the measured stator currents and applied stator voltages in past control periods, the reference voltage value can be calculated based on the principle of DPCC, which is subsequently synthesized by space vector modulation (SVM). This method is compared with conventional DPCC and field-oriented control (FOC), and its superiority is verified by the presented experimental results.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2023.000020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173643","Deadbeat control;current control;robustness;PMSM drives","Current control;Support vector machines;Voltage measurement;System dynamics;Stators;Predictive models;Robustness","","9","","40","","5 Jul 2023","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

The aim of this brief is to reduce the number of multiplexers and achieve an efficient memory usage. One advantage of the proposed architecture is that it only needs permutation circuits after the memories, which reduces the multiplexer usage to only one multiplexer per parallel branch. Another advantage is that the architecture calculates the same permutation based on the perfect shuffle at each iteration. Thus, the shuffling circuits do not need to be configured for different iterations. In fact, all the memories require the same read and write addresses, which simplifies the control even further and allows to merge the memories. Along with the hardware efficiency, conflict-free memory access is fulfilled by a circular counter. The FFT has been implemented on a field programmable gate array. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed architecture has the least number of multiplexers and achieves very low area usage.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2023.3245823","MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and “ERDF A Way of Making Europe”(grant numbers:PID2021-126991NAI00); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and “ESF Investing in Your Future”(grant numbers:RYC2018-025384-I); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey through the International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program(grant numbers:1059B192200354); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045789","Memory-based FFT;perfect shuffle;radix-2","Multiplexing;Memory management;Memory architecture;Hardware;Signal processing algorithms;Indexes;Writing","","9","","20","CCBYNCND","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three IGBT modules with different  $L_{g}$  were fabricated to implement double pulse tests by conventional gate driving and digital control gate driving with three-step vectors. It was found that the tradeoff between switching loss and voltage/current overshoots can be improved by digital control, but a large gate voltage spike was generated when gate-driving vectors were changed. And the spike voltage  $V_{g\_{}spike}$  was positively correlated to the  $L_{g}$ . Although the  $V_{g\_{}spike}$  can also be suppressed by decreasing the difference of gate driving vectors between the first and the second steps, the improvement of the tradeoff is weakened. Therefore, it is required that the  $L_{g}$  inside the IGBT modules should be reduced to suppress the  $V_{g\_{}spike}$  while improving the tradeoff by the digital gate driver at the same time. Furthermore, by analyzing the oscillation of the  $V_{g\_{}spike}$ , it indicates that there should be some other stray elements, which couple  $L_{g}$  and the stray capacitance inside IGBT chips, affecting the  $V_{g\_{}spike}$ .","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3237266","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(grant numbers:JPNP21009); Japan Science and Technology Agency, Support for Pioneer Research Initiated by the Next Generation (JST SPRING)(grant numbers:JPMJSP2136); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018193","IGBT power module;gate inductance;digital gate driver;switching loss;current overshoot;voltage overshoot;gate voltage spike","Logic gates;Insulated gate bipolar transistors;Switches;MOS devices;Inductance;Voltage control;Gate drivers","","8","","19","CCBY","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Suppressing known interference (KI), however, is challenging due to the numerous unknowns, including carrier and sampling frequency offsets, that impact its reception. This letter presents a measurement campaign that captures this challenge and then demonstrates the feasibility of solving that challenge by cancelling the KI using the frequency offsets least mean squares (FO-LMS) algorithm.

In order to address the problem, this study proposes a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition framework based on local domain adaption. A category-grained discrepancy is used to evaluate the distance between two relevant domains.

In many applications, due to computational constraints, it is critical to select only a subset of the received samples for detection. This letter addresses the problem of selecting only a given number of temporal or spatial samples while maximizing detection performance for deterministic signals in first-order autoregressive Gaussian noise. The direct solution of this entails a combinatorial search, where the deflection coefficient is evaluated for each possible combination of sparse samples. This approach is infeasible when the number of samples is large since the number of possible combinations increases factorially with the number of samples. We present an efficient method to whiten Gaussian noise samples and express deflection coefficient in a form that is amenable to dynamic programming. Exploiting dynamic programming, we specify a feasible and efficient procedure to find optimal sparse samples where the number of computational steps increases linearly with the number of samples. Also, conditions under which uniform sampling is optimal is given.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3264106","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-20-1-2820); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091216","Autoregressive process;deflection coefficient;dynamic programming;signal detection;sparse samples;whitening","Covariance matrices;Gaussian noise;Measurement;Dynamic programming;Programming;Data models;Colored noise","","7","","28","CCBY","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, flooding and high wind events were found to have an extremely long tail extending to 60% loss, showing that these discrete events can pose a substantial risk to PV systems. Besides the short-term impact of lost production due to outages, we also found a statistically significant increased performance loss rate (PLR) for high wind events above 90 km/h, by comparing PLR before and after these events. Similarly, hail events caused higher PLR for hail sizes of and above 25 mm indicating that more stringent hail testing for PV modules is required.

Utilizing effective beamforming techniques, antenna arrays have recently played a major part in driving data rates and system capacity to extremely high levels. The beamforming capabilities and system performance are both greatly influenced by the array configuration. Numerous array structures, including linear, two-dimensional, circular, conical, cylindrical, spherical, and even non-uniform array shapes, can be used in different applications. Modern communication systems pay a lot of attention to reconfigurable antennas because of the many applications they may serve and the added functionality they provide. A single structure that has the ability to change between one or a number of features, such as frequency, pattern, and polarization, is referred to as a reconfigurable antenna. Utilizing a specific circular phased microstrip antenna array, the orbital angular moment (OAM) vortex electromagnetic wave is created, allowing for more effective and dependable data transmission. When propagating, the vortex electromagnetic wave has a spiral phase wavefront structure, and its many OAM modes are orthogonal to one another. The helical antenna offers the benefits of light weight, small size, and excellent circular polarization when compared to other OAM radio producing techniques. This paper reviews various state-of-the-art antennas for 5G applications. Specifically, the single microstrip, array, traveling wave and metasurface antennas have been discussed and their important aspects were elaborated.

All devices exhibit 1/ $f$  noise shape with Hooge mobility fluctuations (HMF) at subthreshold region and carrier number fluctuations (CNF) at accumulation region. However, the lowest normalized drain current noise spectral densities ( $S_{Id}/I_{d}^{2}$ ) are obtained in the narrow Fin device ( $\text{W}_{\mathrm {Fin}}$  = 20 nm). This is due to significant contribution of bulk channel without the 2-dimensional electron gas density (2DEG) channel and two sidewall metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) channels. It is also noticed that the lowest trap density ( $N_{t}$ ) and a large separation in CNF noise model clearly indicate to the volume accumulation effect caused by bulk conduction in narrow device. The Hooge constants ( $\alpha _{\mathrm {H}}$ ) extracted by HMF noise model for the narrow device are one-order higher than those of the wide Fin device, which tells that the narrow device suffers from the strong phonon scattering in the bulk channel. From the product of ( $S_{Id} \times $  frequency ( $f$ )) versus  $\text{I}_{\mathrm {d}}$  curves, the volume accumulation phenomenon is also clearly observed in narrow Fin device.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3240409","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST)(grant numbers:NRF-2022R1A2C1003596,2009-0082580); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10029361","AlGaN/GaN FinFET;fin width;low-frequency noise;bulk conduction;volume accumulation","Wide band gap semiconductors;Aluminum gallium nitride;FinFETs;MODFETs;Logic gates;HEMTs;Fluctuations","","7","","27","CCBY","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter one attracted considerable attention over the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G networks in the context of short packet transmission. In this respect, data-oriented approach introduces a transient performance metric for small data transmissions where the amount of data and available bandwidth play an essential role in the performance evaluation.

The method relies on a temporal asymptotic single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel model for diffusive MC systems that takes into account the interaction among receivers. By relying on the asymptotic model, a grid-based likelihood function is a priori created from each known receiver’s perspective. The likelihood function’s computation requires information about the number of molecules released by the transmitter, its position, and the position of known receivers. From the cumulative number of molecules absorbed by the known FA receivers, different likelihood maps are obtained, where each map corresponds to the likelihood of the position of unknown receiver from a specific known receiver’s perspective. By combining the receivers’ likelihood maps, which is equivalent to cooperation by sharing their knowledge, the position of the unknown receiver is estimated. The quality of the estimation is evaluated in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) between the estimated position of the unknown receiver and its true position for different number of released molecules.","2332-7804","","10.1109/TMBMC.2023.3244657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044220","Molecular communication;SIMO channel;receiver localization","Receivers;Transmitters;Numerical models;Location awareness;Estimation;Couplings","","6","","13","CCBY","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ability to generate large quantities of diverse, high-quality data have significant implications in fields such as robotics and computer vision. Synthetic sensor data generation using deep learning techniques involves training a model to generate data that closely resembles real-world sensor data. This is achieved by feeding the model large amounts of real-world data and using it to learn the underlying patterns and structures in the data. Once trained, the model can generate data that are similar in quality and complexity to the original data, but with added variations and noise to increase diversity and realism. Several deep learning techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown impressive results in generating synthetic data for a range of sensors. In this letter, deep learning techniques based on autoregressive convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs) for multivariate time series prediction have been exploited to generate synthetic data for ultrawide band (UWB) and for ultrahigh frequency radio frequency identification (UHF-RFID) sensors. The neural network presented here incorporates measurements from sensors and heterogeneous information, such as the position of the antennas and tags in the environment, to generate synthetic data that can be used to augment real-world data, increasing diversity and robustness of datasets. The deep generation approaches presented here can help researchers generate datasets to validate algorithms without the need for expensive and time-consuming data collection.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3290209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167785","Sensor signal processing;convolutional neural network (CNN);deep neural network (DNN);long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network (ANN);machine learning (ML);ultrawide band (UWB);ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID)","Sensors;Synthetic data;Data models;Training;Radiofrequency identification;Deep learning;Convolution","","5","","16","CCBY","28 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such devices often make use of long leads extending from the device to the relevant nerve to deliver their stimulation. These leads carry a significant radiofrequency (RF) safety concern for patients who also receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The incident RF energy from the MRI body coil can couple with the lead and produce dangerous levels of heating at the tip of the lead during a scan. Recent studies have shown one useful approach to mitigate this heating is to vary the conductivity of the wire along its length to decrease the coupling of the incoming RF energy from the MRI coil with the long lead. In this study, we adopt a similar approach and extend it by segmenting a long cylindrical lead model into two sections of differing conductivities and assessing the maximum 1g specific absorption rate (SAR) at the lead tip at both 64 MHz and 127 MHz. We also evaluated the effect of insulation thickness as well as conductivity of the phantom on the maximum 1g SAR. An 11-fold reduction in the SAR was achieved when using high conductivity ratios between the two wire segments for the 127 MHz coil and a 2-fold reduction was seen for the 64 MHz coil.Clinical relevance— Design of an implantable segmented lead has potential to mitigate RF heating concerns and open a wider patient population to both 1.5T and 3T MRI scans.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340219","","Heating systems;Radiofrequency safety;Magnetic resonance imaging;Wires;Sociology;Phantoms;Lead","Humans;Heating;Prostheses and Implants;Electric Conductivity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","5","","14","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adequate and stable dilation of the pupil are necessary for the successful performance of cataract surgery. Pupillary instability is a known risk factor for cataract surgery complications, and the accurate segmentation of the pupil from surgical video streams can enable the analysis of intraoperative pupil changes in cataract surgery. However, pupil segmentation performance can suffer due to variations in surgical illumination, obscuration of the pupil with surgical instruments, and hydration of the lens material intraoperatively. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel method called tensor-based pupil feature extraction (TPFE) to improve the accuracy of pupil recognition systems. We analyzed the efficacy of this approach with experiments performed on a dataset of 4,560 intraoperative annotated images from 190 cataract surgeries in human patients. Our results indicate that TPFE can identify features relevant to pupil segmentation and that pupil segmentation with state-of-the-art deep learning models can be significantly improved with the TPFE method.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340785","Doctors Company Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340785","","Cataracts;Deep learning;Image segmentation;Biological system modeling;Surgery;Lighting;Streaming media","Humans;Pupil;Cataract Extraction;Lens, Crystalline;Cataract;Surgical Instruments","5","","20","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm first predicts the speech existence probability using a three-layer Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with the speech banding spectrum as the feature. Then it gets the final squelch result by combining the strength of the signal energy and the speech existence probability. Multiple simulations and experiments are done to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We simulate the algorithm in three situations: the typical Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) in the ultra-short wave communication under different SNR environments, the non-stationary burst-like noise environments, and the real received signal of the ultra-short wave radio. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the traditional squelch methods in all the simulations and experiments.

Inappropriate settings can lead to the loss of intrinsic information within a time series. Therefore, two parameter-free methods, namely the intrinsic entropy (IE) and ensemble IE (eIE) methods, are proposed in this paper. The eIE method requires two parameters, which can be easily determined through an orthogonality test. The proposed approaches can measure instantaneous complexity; thus, they do not require a predetermined window size. White noise and three other varieties of colored noise were used to test the stability of the proposed methods, and five types of synthetic signals and logistic maps were applied for measuring instantaneous complexity and regularity. The results revealed that the IE and eIE methods exhibit satisfactory stability. Both methods provide point-by-point entropy measures for time series. The eIE method is useful for measuring the complexity of frequency and amplitude modulation. Furthermore, the periodicity of time series can be detected using the two proposed methods.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3244508","National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST111-2221-EA49-011-MY3); Higher Education Sprout Project of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Ministry of Education of Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042964","Empirical mode decomposition (EMD);instantaneous complexity;intrinsic entropy (IE);signal regularity","Entropy;Complexity theory;White noise;Standards;Time series analysis;Time measurement;Size measurement","","5","","23","CCBY","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Antiarrhythmic drugs can increase the risk of QT prolongation and therefore require strict post-administration monitoring and dosage control. Measurement of the QT interval from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) by a trained expert, in a clinical setting, is the accepted method for tracking QT prolongation. Recent advances in wearable ECG technology, however, raise the possibility of automated out-of-hospital QT tracking. Applications of Deep Learning (DL) - a subfield within Machine Learning - in ECG analysis holds the promise of automation for a variety of classification and regression tasks. In this work, we propose a residual neural network, QTNet, for the regression of QT intervals from a single lead (Lead-I) ECG. QTNet is trained in a supervised manner on a large ECG dataset from a U.S. hospital. We demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of QTNet on four test-sets; one from the same hospital, one from another U.S. hospital, and two public datasets. Over all four datasets, the mean absolute error (MAE) in the estimated QT interval ranges between 9ms and 15.8ms. Pearson correlation coefficients vary between 0.899 and 0.914. By contrast, QT interval estimation on these datasets with a standard method for automated ECG analysis (NeuroKit2) yields MAEs between 22.29ms and 90.79ms, and Pearson correlation coefficients 0.345 and 0.620. These results demonstrate the utility of QTNet across distinct datasets and patient populations, thereby highlighting the potential utility of DL models for ubiquitous QT tracking.Clinical Relevance— QTNet can be applied to inpatient or ambulatory Lead-I ECG signals to track QT intervals. The method facilitates ambulatory monitoring of patients at risk of QT prolongation.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341204","","Drugs;Measurement;Hospitals;Electrocardiography;Lead;Robustness;Monitoring","Humans;Deep Learning;Electrocardiography;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Anti-Arrhythmia Agents;Long QT Syndrome","5","","15","CCBY","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Participants were employees of DENSO CORPORATION's manufacturing facilities, and environmental sensors (for temperature and humidity) and BLE beacons were installed to cover the work area. Questionnaires were completed by the participants twice to assess their thermal comfort and fatigue in the work environment. The results showed that a regression prediction model with an adjusted R-squared of 0.418 for fixed-point temperature and 0.495 for perceived temperature was developed for thermal comfort. No linear relationship was found between environmental factors and fatigue, and a decision tree analysis was conducted. Relative humidity and activity level, along with temperature, were selected as predictor variables. The findings suggest that it is possible to estimate the work environment and workload without adding additional measurement-related burdens or challenges. This highlights the usefulness of the proposed method, which takes into account the environmental distribution throughout the work area rather than relying solely on conventional fixed-point observation data, for assessing workers' exposure to the environment and preventing occupational accidents.Clinical Relevance— The proposed approach, combining indoor localization with environmental status, can estimate the condition of workers and is expected to be a good solution for preventing occupational accidents and enhancing workers’ health.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340890","Technology Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340890","","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Temperature;Humidity;Fatigue;Production facilities;Accidents","Humans;Humidity;Temperature;Workload;Working Conditions;Fatigue","4","","14","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Notably, prompt engineering has gained attention as a method capable of improving LLM performance by modifying the structure of input prompts alone. In this study, we apply prompt engineering to Korean-based LLMs, presenting an efficient approach for generating specific conversational responses with less data. We achieve this through the utilization of the query transformation module (QTM). Our proposed QTM transforms input prompt sentences into three distinct query methods, breaking them down into objectives and key points, making them more comprehensible for LLMs. For performance validation, we employ Korean versions of LLMs, specifically SKT GPT-2 and Kakaobrain KoGPT-3. We compare four different query methods, including the original unmodified query, using Google SSA to assess the naturalness and specificity of generated sentences. The results demonstrate an average improvement of 11.46% when compared to the unmodified query, underscoring the efficacy of the proposed QTM in achieving enhanced performance.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452390","AI;large language model;generative AI;few-shot learning;prompt engineering;AI Chatbot","Generative AI;Transforms;Chatbots;Internet","","4","","29","","27 Feb 2024","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

"LIV: Loop-Invariant Validation Using Straight-Line Programs","D. Beyer; M. Spiessl","LMU, Munich, Germany; LMU, Munich, Germany",2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),"8 Nov 2023","2023","","","2074","2077","Validation of program invariants (a.k.a. correctness witnesses) is an established procedure in software verification. There are steady advances in verification of more and more complex software systems, but coming up with good loop invariants remains the central task of many verifiers. While it often requires large amounts of computation to construct safe and inductive invariants, they are more easy to automatically validate. We propose LIV, a new tool for loop-invariant validation, which makes it more practical to check if the invariant produced by a verifier is sufficient to establish an inductive safety proof. The main idea is to apply divide-and-conquer on the program level: We split the program into smaller, loop-free programs (a.k.a. straight-line programs) that form simpler verification tasks. Because the verification conditions are not encoded in logic syntax (such as SMT), but as programs in the language of the original program, any off-the-shelf verifier can be used to verify the generated straight-line programs. In case the validation fails, useful information can be extracted about which part of the proof failed (which straight-line programs are wrong). We show that our approach works by evaluating it on a suitable benchmark.

However, compared against FinFET device structure, the GAA device is not very cost-effective. In addition, its yield for mass production is not as high as expected. In order to explore the device design option for extending the current FinFET device out, we have come up with a new idea, i.e., novel device structure to increase the effective channel width without affecting the contacted poly pitch (CPP). A novel u-FinFET structure is a type of FinFET that has a u-shaped channel. By using 3-D TCAD simulation, it turned out that the u-FinFET (vs. conventional bulk/SOI FinFETs) shows a 27.3% higher drain current at  $V_{\mathrm {GS}}$  = 0.7 V because of its 28.7% wider effective channel width. Especially, the u-FinFET can be adopted for high performance applications because it can implement a wider channel width for a given layout area. Moreover, taking advantages of using the current processes and materials for bulk/SOI FinFET, the u-FinFET can be fabricated (which must be very cost-effective). Hence, with taking advantages of using the u-FinFET structure, the current FinFET platform would last more.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3308592","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government through the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP)(grant numbers:2020R1A2C1009063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10230235","FinFET;SOI FinFET;u-FinFET;device design","FinFETs;Logic gates;Performance evaluation;Silicon;Semiconductor process modeling;Transconductance;Three-dimensional displays;Design engineering","","4","","26","CCBYNCND","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, many existing AC approaches rely on source-target parallel speech data during training or reference speech at run-time. We propose a novel accent conversion framework without the need for either parallel data or reference speech. Specifically, a text-to-speech (TTS) system is first pretrained with target-accented speech data. This TTS model and its hidden representations are expected to be associated only with the target accent. Then, a speech encoder is trained to convert the accent of the speech under the supervision of the pretrained TTS model. In doing so, the source-accented speech and its corresponding transcription are forwarded to the speech encoder and the pretrained TTS, respectively. The output of the speech encoder is optimized to be the same as the text embedding in the TTS system. At run-time, the speech encoder is combined with the pretrained speech decoder to convert the source-accented speech toward the target. In the experiments, we converted English with two source accents (Chinese/Indian) to the target accent (American/British/Canadian). Both objective metrics and subjective listening tests successfully validate that the proposed approach generates speech samples that are close to the target accent with high speech quality.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3270079","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271432); Human-Robot Collaborative AI for Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering(grant numbers:A18A2b0046); Agency for Science, Technology and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107770","Accent conversion (AC);text-to-speech (TTS)","Acoustics;Training;Decoding;Feature extraction;Data models;Phonetics;Error analysis","","4","","35","CCBY","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hybrid time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) localization techniques are commonly used due to their high accuracy. The conventional TOA/AOA localization algorithms require both zenith and azimuth angle estimations at each agent. Since a zenith-and-azimuth AOA estimation requires an L-shape antenna array and complicated 2-D signal processing, conventional TOA/AOA algorithms lead to both hardware and computational complexity and high power consumption at each agent. This letter proposes a hybrid TOA/AOA localization algorithm, named $\text{T1A}_{a}$, to reduce the agents' complexity. $\text{T1A}_{a}$ only combines TOA-ranging with the azimuth angle estimation. Thereby, agents only require a 1-D antenna array, less complicated signal processing, and thus, lower power consumption. Such improvements are important for power-limited WSNs and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. Simulations are conducted to prove that the proposed $\text{T1A}_{a}$ technique can achieve similar performance as conventional TOA/AOA methods, while significantly simplifying agents' complexity.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3322968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274092","Sensor signal processing;angle-of-arrival (AOA);non-GPS localization;time-of-arrival (TOA);unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);wireless sensor network (WSN)","Location awareness;Azimuth;Signal processing algorithms;Estimation;Wireless sensor networks;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Bandwidth","","4","","10","CCBY","9 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing bathymetric photon extraction algorithms need more adaptability to seafloor topography. The changing density of bathymetric photons and the fluctuation of underwater topography make the noise removal of nearshore data full of challenges. This study proposed a bathymetric photon extraction algorithm using pre-pruning quadtree isolation (PQI). First, the pre-pruning step judges whether to stop the growth of quadtree in advance during quadtree isolation (QI) to avoid excessive division of noise photons. Second, the maximum inter-class variance algorithm (also called the Otsu method) obtains the best threshold of isolation depth (ID) and extracts bathymetric photons.

However, motion artifacts and environmental factors easily corrupt cECG signal quality and reduce the diagnostic value of unobtrusively collected cECG. To evaluate the atrial fibrillation (AF) screening performance of cECG compared to ECG, we conduct three different experiments on the clinical UnoViS dataset consisting of 55 min of concurrent ECG and cECG signals from 92 patients with manual clinician annotations of AF. First, we trained and evaluated models to detect AF events on cECG and ECG separately. Then, we trained a model using ECG and evaluated it on cECG to measure the interchangeability of the ECG and cECG domains. For each experiment five-fold subjectwise, class-stratified cross-validation was used to assess trained algorithm performance on hold-out test sets and three different algorithmic methodologies were assessed. Although evaluating the trained ECG model on cECG data (AUC: 0.874 ± 0.067, F1-score: 0.553 ± 0.148) performed slightly worse than evaluating on ECG, it did perform better than the model trained and evaluated on cECG alone, which suggests that utilizing ECG data for model training can effectively screen similar conditions in cECG data.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3315223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10251571","Sensor applications;capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG);atrial fibrillation (AF);noninvasive sensors","Electrocardiography;Measurement;Training;Data models;Feature extraction;Atrial fibrillation;Skin","","4","","23","CCBY","14 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A remarkable spectral splitting behavior is achieved with large Rabi splitting of 192 meV due to the strong resonant coupling between the anapole and FP cavity modes. The induced two hybrid energy states are respectively dominated by the anapole mode and cavity mode and can be tuned by the length of FP nanocavity and the thickness of SiO2 spacer, respectively.

The incidence of falls with major injuries has increased with the growth of the older adult population, and has further risen as a result of reduced physical mobility in recent years due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The standard of care in the effort to reduce major injuries from falling is provided by the CDC through an evidence-based fall risk screening, assessment and intervention initiative (STEADI: Stopping Elderly Accidents and Death Initiative) and is embedded into primary care models throughout residential and institutional settings nationwide. Though the dissemination of this practice has been successfully implemented, recent studies have shown that major injuries from falls have not been reduced. Emerging technology adapted from other industries offers adjunctive intervention in the older adult population at risk of falls and major fall injuries. Technology in the form of a wearable smartbelt that offers automatic airbag deployment to reduce impact forces to the hip region in serious hip-impacting fall scenarios was assessed in a long-term care facility. Device performance was examined in a real-world case series of residents who were identified as being at high-risk of major fall injuries within a long-term care setting. In a timeframe of almost 2 years, 35 residents wore the smartbelt, and 6 falls with airbag deployment occurred with a concomitant reduction in the overall falls with major injury rate.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2023.3256893","Active Protective Technologies, Inc., Fort Washington, PA, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070834","Falls;fall injury;hip injury;older adults;wearable technology;intervention","Injuries;Older adults;Hip;Statistics;Sociology;Wheelchairs;Performance evaluation","Humans;Aged;Accidental Falls;Long-Term Care;Nursing Homes;Incidence;Wearable Electronic Devices","4","","15","CCBY","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed approach is able to reach a source location error of 0.8 cm by exploiting pseudo-measurements of the plane fitting constraint acquired by a passive ToF camera, which exploits a bistatic algorithm with a gradient descent method. Computer experiments are carried out to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in realistic scenarios where no initial guess is available.

Moreover, the conventional RV-based MC-DTC has limited practical application, as it suffers from increased torque ripple and current distortion. A novel MC-DTC method using RVs is proposed in this paper, which breaks down the compromise between minimization of CMV and performance of torque and current. Two RVs that rotate in opposite directions are employed to synthesize a virtual vector. These virtual vectors are pulsating in a fixed line and are evenly distributed in the vector plane. Therefore, the switching table with virtual pulsating vectors can be established conveniently. The proposed method can not only eliminate common-mode voltage, but also improve the torque and current steady state performances evidently compared with the existing rotating vector-based method.

An effective approach is the implementation of an active stereo system, using a micro-sized pattern projector and an endoscope camera, which has been intensively developed. One open problem for such a system is the necessity of strict and complex calibration of the projector-camera system to precisely recover the shapes. Moreover, since the head of an endoscope should have enough elasticity to avoid harming target objects, the positions of the pattern projector cannot be tightly fixed to the head, resulting in limited accuracy. A straightforward approach to the problem is applying auto-calibration. However, it requires special markers in the pattern or a highly accurate initial position for stable calibration, which is impractical for real operation. In the paper, we propose a novel auto-calibration method based on differential rendering techniques, which are recently proposed and drawing wide attention. To apply the method to an endoscopic system, where a diffractive optical element (DOE) is used, we propose a technique to simultaneously estimate the focal length of the DOE as well as the extrinsic parameters between a projector and a camera. We also propose a multi-frame optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, relative pose between frames, and the entire shape.Clinical relevance— One-shot endoscopic measurement of depth information is a practical solution for cancer diagnosis, computer-assisted interventions, and making annotations for machine learning training data.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340381","","Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Endoscopes;Training data;Rendering (computer graphics);Cameras;Cancer","Humans;Calibration;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Endoscopes;Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal;Neoplasms","3","","21","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, GA is known for its high implementation cost and typically requires a large number of iterations. On the other hand, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a relatively new heuristic technique inspired by the collective behaviors of real organisms. Both GA and PSO algorithms are prominent heuristic optimization methods that belong to the population-based approaches family. While they are often seen as competitors, their efficiency heavily relies on the parameter values chosen and the specific optimization problem at hand. In this study, we aim to compare the runtime performance of GA and PSO algorithms within a cutting-edge edge and fog cloud architecture.

Different small devices have different sizes of fingerprint sensors. The scanned fingerprint image through a small fingerprint sensor is a partial fingerprint image instead of a whole fingerprint image, if we use a small fingerprint sensor. If the size of the partial fingerprints stored in the database decreases, the number of minutiae that are compared when matching decreases. Unfortunately, for the small number of minutiae, it is possible to construct “Masterprints”. Masterprints can be used to impersonate multiple users stored in the database. If the size of a partial image is 15 % of a whole image, a Masterprint can be produced. We investigate the vulnerability of various sizes of partial images due to the Masterprint. Because sensors have different sizes, we use partial images of 9% to 48% of a whole image. Our results show that the security of partial fingerprint authentication is severely affected by the sizes of partial images and sensors. The smaller the partial image size, the larger the impostor matching rate; and the smaller the false matching rates, the steeper the impostor matching rate increases.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3312176","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2022R1I1A1A01068594); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10239342","Fingerprint;authentication;sensors;partial images;Masterprint","Authentication;Sensors;Image sensors;Databases;Biosensors;Optical sensors;Fingerprint recognition","","3","","19","CCBYNCND","5 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The asymmetric rotor design with position-biased magnet realizes the concentration of magnetic field lines in the motor air gap to obtain higher electromagnetic torque, and makes both of magnetic and reluctance torque obtain the peak value at the same current phase angle. The asymmetric rotor configuration is theoretically illustrated by space vector diagram, and the feasibility of high torque performance of the motor is verified. Through the finite element simulation, the effect of the side barrier on output torque and the Mises stress under the rotor asymmetrical design are analyzed. Then the motor characteristics including airgap flux density, back EMF, magnetic torque, reluctance torque, torque ripple, losses, and efficiency are calculated for both the basic and proposed PMA-SynRMs. The results show that the proposed PMA-SynRM has higher torque and efficiency than the basic topology. Moreover, the torque ripple of the proposed PMA-SynRM is reduced by the method with harmonic current injection, and the torque characteristics in the whole current cycle are analyzed.

Its absence is a critical indicator of various ocular or neurological abnormalities. Recent advances in imaging technology have enabled the development of portable smartphone-based devices for observing the retina and assessment of SVPs. However, the quality of smartphone-based retinal videos is often poor due to noise and image jitting, which in return, can severely obstruct the observation of SVPs. In this work, we developed a fully automated retinal video stabilization method that enables the examination of SVPs captured by various mobile devices. Specifically, we first propose an ODR Spatio-Temporal Localization (ODR-STL) module to localize visible ODR and remove noisy and jittering frames. Then, we introduce a Noise-Aware Template Matching (NATM) module to stabilize high-quality video segments at a fixed position in the field of view. After the processing, the SVPs can be easily observed in the stabilized videos, significantly facilitating user observations. Furthermore, our method is cost-effective and has been tested in both subjective and objective evaluations. Both of the evaluations support its effectiveness in facilitating the observation of SVPs.

However, accurately determining harvest-readiness can be challenging due to the cauliflower head being covered by its canopy. While deep learning enables automated harvest-readiness estimation, errors can occur due to field-variability and limited training data. In this letter, we analyze the reliability of a harvest-readiness classifier with interpretable machine learning. By identifying clusters of saliency maps, we derive reliability scores for each classification result using knowledge about the domain and the image properties.

The advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs) and optics led to the fabrication of flexible endoscopes as small as a few millimeters in diameter. The design of a sub-millimeter sized optical fiber scanner is presented in this paper. The proposed scanner consisted of a vibrating optical fiber that carried the laser light to the targeted imaging sample. The desired vibratory motion of the scanning device was obtained using a U-shaped electrothermal actuator where the asymmetry in the actuator’s arm length caused the free end of the actuating device to bend allowing a bidirectional motion at its free end. The periodic square current wave passing through the actuator caused it to bend in a timely manner. By matching the signal frequency to the resonant frequency of the cantilever fiber and placing the cantilever appropriately relative to the actuator, the distal end of the fiber was allowed to follow a Lissajous scan. In optical scanners, the Lissajous scan pattern is normally obtained using a pair of actuators. This paper presents the design of a scanner providing a 2D Lissajous scan using a single actuator. Such a technique can provide basis for the development of sub-millimeter sized forward-viewing endoscopic catheters, whereas the smallest single fiber endoscope has a diameter of 1.2 mm. In the medical field, such a device has the potential to image small cavities of the body increasing the diagnostic yield of the medical procedures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3295782","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canada Research Chair (CRC) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183998","Electrothermal actuator;fiber optic scanner;MEMS;micro-cantilever;resonance vibration","Optical fibers;Optical fiber devices;Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Electrothermal actuators;Bridge circuits;Microelectromechanical systems;Structural beams;Resonance","","3","","23","CCBYNCND","14 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The mechanical loading steps include cool-down to cryogenic temperatures and Lorentz forces when powering up the magnets. Studying the mechanical behavior of the constituent layers in a HTS tape can reveal the strain or stress level in each layer and help in predicting the probability of mechanical failure or critical current degradation. A detailed finite element method (FEM)-based simulation models enable us to estimate the mechanical behavior in each layer. However, defining the model parameters for material mechanical properties or thickness of each material layer can have considerable uncertainty due to variation in manufacturing processes and missing measurements of material properties within these tapes. The material properties in thin layers may not exactly comply with bulk materials of the same kind. In this paper we present a sensitivity analysis for mechanical behavior dependence on material properties variation in the constituent layers of a HTS tape. The results give important insight about the accuracy and reliability of mechanical simulation results and guide the priorities in future material characterization. In addition, we will investigate the effect of the thickness of Hastelloy layer on effective macroscopic mechanical behavior of the tape. A nonlinear elastoplastic FEM model is used for performing the simulations.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3251293","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:324887); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056987","FEM;HTS tapes;mechanical analysis;YBCO","Yttrium barium copper oxide;Behavioral sciences;Stress;Loading;Material properties;Strain;Sensitivity analysis","","3","","11","CCBY","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This translation is used in a variety of applications like voice enabled commands, assistive devices and bots, etc. There is a significant lack of efficient technology for Indian languages. In this paper, an wavelet transformer for automatic speech recognition (WTASR) of Indian language is proposed. The speech signals suffer from the problem of high and low frequency over different times due to variation in speech of the speaker. Thus, wavelets enable the network to analyze the signal in multiscale. The wavelet decomposition of the signal is fed in the network for generating the text. The transformer network comprises an encoder decoder system for speech translation. The model is trained on Indian language dataset for translation of speech into corresponding text. The proposed method is compared with other state of the art methods. The results show that the proposed WTASR has a low word error rate and can be used for effective speech recognition for Indian language.","2097-406X","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962811","transformer;wavelet;automatic speech recognition (ASR);Indian language","Wavelet transforms;Time-frequency analysis;Error analysis;Soft sensors;Predictive models;Transformers;Wavelet analysis","","3","","18","","24 Nov 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this letter, we present a methodology and a polynomial-time algorithm that determines the exact impact of information leakage on a generated bit sequence and expressed these findings in terms of the achieved level of bit security.

Fossen","Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway",IEEE Access,"10 Feb 2023","2023","11","","12587","12593","The overall goal of the paper is to derive a kinematic model for vehicle path-following systems, where the pitch and yaw angles  $(\theta, \psi)$  together with the surge velocity  $u$  can be treated as control inputs. Then the outer control loop can be designed as a nonlinear path-following guidance law. At the same time, the inner control loops can be stabilized using commercial autopilot systems to control the pitch and yaw angles. The main result of the paper is a novel kinematic amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down (NED) positional rates, which can replace the classical Euler angle rotation matrix representation. The proposed kinematic model gives equivalent NED positional rates as the rotation matrix representation for all combinations of the Euler angles and the linear velocities. The main advantage of the kinematic amplitude-phase representation is the design of vehicle guidance laws using nonlinear control theory and Lyapunov stability analysis. Furthermore, it is shown that nonlinear guidance laws can be designed for path following and that the proposed methods guarantee that the origins are uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable (USGES). A case study of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) demonstrates how a path-following control system can be designed using the amplitude-phase representation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3242331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036424","Aircraft;autonomous vehicles;guidance systems;kinematics;marine vehicles;mobile robot kinematics;underwater vehicles","Mobile robots;Surges;Autopilot;Differential equations;Mathematical models;Aircraft;Autonomous vehicles;Robot kinematics;Autonomous underwater vehicles","","3","","25","CCBY","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To date, quite a lot of studies have been reported for chromatic aberration correction of metalenses. Noting most work was carried out to satisfy the required group delay or dispersion by introducing sophisticated and integrated nanopillars, which are obtained using computationally intensive global search algorithms. Generally, the design is time-consuming. Here, we propose an alternative scheme, where metalens that corrects the chromatic aberration can be designed by optimizing the spectral degree of freedom C(ω), rather than relying on time-consuming algorithms. The proposed metalens is compatible with the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication process. The numerically demonstrated metalens with a diameter of 200 μm and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.24 has a small focal length fractional change (FLFC) of 4.1% over the wavelength of 9∼12 μm with an average efficiency of 51.7% in transmission mode. Moreover, the effect of fabrication deviations on the performance of the metalens is analyzed, showing critical dimension (CD) bias, sidewall angle and pillar height all have different levels of influence on the performance of the metalens.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3243409","Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Applications of Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10041802","Metasurface;metalens;achromatic focusing;long-wave infrared (LWIR)","Delays;Dispersion;Lenses;Silicon;Metasurfaces;Focusing;Optical imaging","","3","","44","CCBY","9 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a benefit, there is no double-frequency oscillation in the estimated phases at off-nominal frequencies since the positive and negative sequence phases are obtained simultaneously. The proposed method not only has the inherent advantages of OLS, but also further improves the dynamic response since the window length of MAF is only 1/6 of the fundamental period.

For addressing this problem, a high-frequency switching harmonic elimination method is proposed without communication and centralized controllers. In the proposed method, voltage harmonic information on the parallel input side is sampled for the closed-loop regulation of the current harmonic phase, and the harmonic minimization of the specific frequency is thereby achieved. Compared with the traditional high-frequency harmonic elimination method (centralized interleaved parallel connection), the proposed method can achieve plug-and-play without communication and is insensitive to the electrical parameters of the modules.

However, gSCR is originally based on the assumption of homogeneous MIDC systems, in which all high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converters have an identical control configuration, thus presenting challenges to applications of gSCR to inhomogeneous MIDC systems. To weaken this assumption, this paper applies matrix perturbation theory to explore the possibility of utilization of gSCR into inhomogeneous MIDC systems. Results of numerical experiments show that in inhomogeneous MIDC systems, the previously proposed gSCR can still be used without modification. However, critical gSCR (CgSCR) must be redefined by considering the characteristics of control configurations of HVDC converter. Accordingly, the difference between gSCR and redefined CgSCR can effectively quantify the pertinent AC grid strength in terms of the static-voltage stability margin. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in a triple-infeed inhomogeneous line commutated converter based high-voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841519","Generalized short circuit ratio (gSCR);multi-infeed high-voltage direct current system;modal perturbation;static-voltage stability","Nonhomogeneous media;HVDC transmission;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Power system stability;Stability criteria;Boundary conditions;Matrix converters","","3","","10","","26 Jul 2022","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

These models are also typically batched for inference to improve the serving throughput. All these trends enable the models’ weights to be reused effectively, increasing the relative importance of sequence generation, especially in processing KV matrices through attention. We identify that the conventional computing platforms (e.g., GPUs) are not efficient at handling this attention part for inference because each request generates different KV matrices, it has a low operation per byte ratio regardless of the batch size, and the aggregate size of the KV matrices can even surpass that of the entire model weights. This motivates us to propose AttAcc, which exploits the fact that the KV matrices are written once during summarization but used many times (proportional to the output sequence length), each multiplied by the embedding vector corresponding to an output token. The volume of data entering/leaving AttAcc could be more than orders of magnitude smaller than what should be read internally for attention. We design AttAcc with multiple processing-in-memory devices, each multiplying the embedding vector with the portion of the KV matrices within the devices, saving external (inter-device) bandwidth and energy consumption.","1556-6064","","10.1109/LCA.2023.3305386","Institute of IITP grant funded by the Korea government(grant numbers:2021-0-00863,IITP-2023-RS-2023-00256081); PRISM; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10218731","Transformer-based generative model;processing-in-memory;attention","Decoding;Throughput;Memory management;Computational modeling;Transformers;Context modeling;Matrix converters","","3","","11","CCBYNCND","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The element of the ECMSAA is constructed by loading the single electric-controlled metasurface unit on the conventional patch antenna element. The radiation properties of the conventional patch antenna and the reflection performance of electric-controlled metasurface are maintained when the antenna and the metasurface are integrated. Thus, the ECMSAA elements have excellent radiation properties and ultra-wideband frequency reconfigurable in-phase reflection characteristics simultaneously. To take a further step, a $6 \times 10$ ECMSAA is realized based on the designed metasurface antenna element. Simulated and measured results prove that the reflection of the ECMSAA is dynamically suppressed in the P and L bands.

The reason for that is the patch-type electrocardiograph being smaller and lighter than the Holter monitor, making it more convenient for patients to coexist with in their daily lives. However, this type of electrocardiograph generates a lot of noise signals due to movements during various physical activities and extended wear time.While analyzing electrocardiograms automatically using software, noise signals make the analysis difficult and they may be misclassified as arrhythmia signals. These misclassified signals require a lot of effort and time from clinical technicians to reclassify them as noise. To resolve this problem, this study hypothesized that a deep learning algorithm could be used to screen noise signals. We used 7,467 noise signals and 15,638 ECG signals collected from arrhythmia patients and healthy people. The signals were divided into 10 seconds segments and labeled by cardiologists. We split the data into training and test datasets, ensuring no patient overlap.A hybrid noise classification model, Squeeze and Excitation - Residual Network - Vision Transformer (SE-ResNet-ViT) was developed using the training and validation datasets with an 8:2 ratio. We evaluated the performance of the model using a test dataset. The best F1 score was 0.964.

High radioactivity caused by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality images with minimum ‘low-dose’, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented. Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis.

"Reaching the Frequency Resolution Limit in a Single-Shot Spectrum of an Ultra-Short Signal Pulse Using an Analog Optical Auto-Correlation Technique","W.

It provides unprecedented capability to reach the fundamental limit in Physics. This technique allows us to increase the observation/measurement time by converting a Radio Frequency (RF) signal in the optical domain and keeping the “live-signal” in a fiber-optic-recirculation-loop circuit over an extended time that could be a million times longer than the pulse width. The dispersion delay of the two RF modulation sidebands is used to perform an analog time correlation. It effectively stretches time by million times. As a result, it provides a frequency-space “snapshot” of ultra-short events without the need for a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A single 30 ns-short two-tone pulse separated by 25 MHz was resolved in a 50 GHz wideband real-time frequency spectrum. This technique allowed us to push the physical limit in the spectral resolution of an ultra-short signal and enable a new technology to manipulate, process, and analyze ultra-short electromagnetic signals and transient events. It also provokes a fundamental question: Is the uncertainty principle limiting the frequency determination for a wave in a continuum state?","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2022.3213188","U.S. Army; CCDC Army Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9914568","Analog optical autocorrelation;electro-optics;fiber-optic-recirculation-loop;frequency resolution;fundamental limit in physics;optics;photonics;RF-photonics;single-shot spectrum analyzer;uncertainty principle","Radio frequency;Optical pulses;Optical fibers;Signal resolution;Optical filters;Signal detection;Correlation","","2","","16","CCBY","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, respiratory motions of five participants were recorded using three millimeter-wave radar systems; cross validation was also performed. The average error in estimating body orientation angle was 38.3$^\circ$ and 23.1$^\circ$ using, respectively, a conventional method with only the fundamental frequency component and our proposed method, indicating an improvement in accuracy by a factor of 1.7 when using the proposed method.

A high torque density should be obtained by increasing both the main field and the armature current loading. However, there are tendencies that the main field can be low but the armature current loading can be high, such as permanent magnet superconducting generators. Despite $J_\mathrm{{c}}(B,T)$ characteristics and AC loss issues, simply using superconducting armature may not lead to a desired design result but deteriorate the performance with high armature reaction. This paper implements the vector-phasor diagram of non-salient synchronous generators for revealing the potential performance of only increasing the armature current loading. Three commonly used control strategies are compared. The results show that increasing the armature-field flux to a certain level will deteriorate the generator performance with all three control strategies. Comparatively, the voltage control for equaling EMF and voltage amplitudes provides the best overall performance: high torque production capability, high power factor, small power angle and a wide range of armature current loading. The results obtained from the vector-phasor diagrams are verified by finite element models with an FSCG design.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3255826","Academy of Finland project(grant numbers:336287); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10066499","Armature winding;control;fully superconducting generator;synchronous machine;wind turbine","Generators;Windings;Superconducting magnets;Torque;Reactive power;Voltage control;Loading","","2","","32","CCBY","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the master-slave control mode adopted in the project of paralleled MMC stations, the current imbalance issues would inevitably occur among the paralleled MMCs in the case of power change, DC voltage drop and short-circuit fault conditions, which could result in overcurrent in MMCs or even slow down the fault recovery process. To realize the current of MMC group distributed evenly, a power-based compensation control is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the imbalanced current between power-controlled and voltage-controlled MMCs is deduced, then the imbalanced current is transformed into active power, and finally the obtained active power is compensated to the active power outer loop control. By compensating the active power reference value, the proposed control approach can achieve the current balancing of paralleled MMCs under different conditions. The HC-HVDC system, based on the Baihetan-Jiangsu project which is currently under construction, is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

However, penalty parameter optimization of the penalty terms is very difficult and extremely time-consuming. Additionally, the Euclidean projection onto the check polytope is the most complex part of ADMM-based decoding algorithms. In this paper, by dynamically choosing even-vertex in the check polytope closest to the input vector as the approximate projection, a simple and novel check polytope projection penalized algorithm for ADMM decoding is proposed which can avoid the tedious work of penalty parameter optimization and simplify the check polytope projection. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can substantially reduce the projection time while achieving better FER performance when compared with the existing penalized decoding. In particular, the proposed algorithm can save the decoding time by 23% to 41% compared with ADMM-PD-LSA algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3234182","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005277","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM);low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes;penalty terms;check polytope projection","Maximum likelihood decoding;Approximation algorithms;Convex functions;Projection algorithms;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical models","","2","","22","CCBYNCND","4 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In its general implementation, it consists of n capacitively coupled stacked class-D oscillators, each one loaded by a primary transformer winding. Capacitive coupling between the oscillators guarantees robust frequency/phase synchronization. The oscillation voltages are combined at the secondary transformer winding, thus ideally producing the same oscillation amplitude of a class-D topology with a power consumption reduced by a factor of 1/n thanks to the current-reuse configuration. With respect to traditional topologies, capacitive-coupled stacked class-D oscillators also allow standard MOS transistors (i.e., with a low breakdown voltage) to be reliably operated at higher supply voltages. The oscillator advantages have been highlighted in comparison with the traditionally adopted complementary cross-coupled topology within an isolated data link based on RF planar coupling in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS technology.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2022.3228980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983837","Breakdown;capacitive coupling;current reuse;galvanic isolation;on-chip antennas;oscillator;voltage combining","Oscillators;Couplings;Topology;Isolators;Radio frequency;Antennas;Windings","","2","","19","CCBY","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In CISPR band C/D, the test receiver needs to fulfill stringent requirements for using the quasi-peak detector. Usually, an expensive preselection filter bank is necessary to make fully compliant measurements of broadband transients. Direct-conversion-based SDRs show a limited out-of-the-box performance for precompliance measurements caused by, e.g., harmonic mixing and saturation effects. With the use of a triple-balanced mixer, a highly linear upconversion stage is built, eliminating the need for a filter bank. The dynamic range (DR) requirements for the SDR are strongly reduced by a narrowband intermediate frequency filter, making CISPR 16-1-1 compliant measurements possible. The sensitivity of the front end is comparable to professional receivers on the market, although no low-noise amplifier is implemented. The performance is verified by continuous wave (CW) and transient signals according to CISPR norms. The broadband measurement results are compared with traditional characterizations of the DR using the compression level and the noise figure. It shows that assumptions on the RF-link budget for a compliant design can be made with CW measurements. Based on our results, the requirements for the SDR front end are derived.","2637-6423","","10.1109/LEMCPA.2022.3227409","Interreg EFRE Foundation(grant numbers:AMOR ATCZ-203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973334","CISPR;electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);electromagnetic interference (EMI);software-defined radio (SDR)","Mixers;Filter banks;Receivers;Noise measurement;Power harmonic filters;Electromagnetic interference;Harmonic analysis","","2","","12","CCBYNCND","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, the scene is classified in terms of the structures assumed by the covariance under specific symmetric scattering mechanisms. To do this, for each pixel under test, the data in a reference window are filtered through the application of a generalized inner product (GIP)-based procedure involving the median matrix in its computation. The filtered data are then used as input to a model order selection (MOS)-based procedure for the final scene classification.

The stray inductance caused by the bus bar geometries between DC capacitors and power devices influences high-speed switching circuits, such as surge voltages and switching losses. Therefore, the evaluation of the parasitic parameters is essential in designing power converter circuits. Currently, parasitic parameters that consider various bus bar geometries are calculated using finite element analysis (FEA) each time, which requires a large calculation time. This article proposes a prediction procedure for the parasitic parameters that easily and quickly consider complex bus bar geometries by performing online machine learning of FEA-based datasets. A laminated bus bar with two apertures to connect DC capacitors or power modules is analyzed, and the parasitic resistance, inductance, and capacitance are predicted. This article describes how large datasets can be obtained from multiple installments and perform online machine learning using XGBoost. To discuss the benefits of online machine learning, the prediction accuracy using test data in multiple machine learning models with different amounts of training data is compared. The mean relative error (MRE) between the predicted and analyzed values improves from 250% to 8% when parasitic parameters are predicted in the frequency range of 50 kHz to 100 MHz.","2644-1314","","10.1109/OJPEL.2023.3285780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149472","Stray inductance;laminated bus bar;finite element analysis;machine learning;parasitic parameter","Bars;Machine learning;Integrated circuit modeling;Apertures;Training;Geometry;Inductance","","2","","23","CCBY","13 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two modes of operation of the circuit have been analyzed: the nominal and the “isolation” mode, i.e., when the cryogenic circuit valves are operated to isolate the coil during the current dumps. The computed mass flow rate, pressure and coil outlet temperature at different locations have been compared with the measurements, showing a very good agreement in both modes of operation of the circuit. The validated model helped in the interpretation of the experimental results, such as the backflow at the coil inlet -which cannot be measured- or the non-monotonic outlet temperature evolution following the current dump.

We previously proposed a Norton-based two-port equivalent-circuit model excluding load to investigate the load effect on EMI. The EMI prediction presupposes constant internal impedances independent of the load change with only the noise current source change dependent on the load change. Under these conditions, the noise current source at any load can be calculated by using the numerical interpolation method. In this work, we used a dc–dc buck converter with a switching frequency of 200 kHz and identified the model parameters precisely by applying the waveform decomposition method. The internal admittances were found to be almost constant with respect to load change and only the input-port current source decreased with load. We then applied the cubic spline interpolation method to fit the input-port current source and calculate it at any load. This approach was verified by predicting the input-port noise voltage for loads between 3.3 and  $15.6~\Omega $ . Below 80 MHz, where the input-port current source decreased with load, the input-port voltage predicted using the input-port current source fitted by interpolation was in good agreement with the measured one.","2637-6423","","10.1109/LEMCPA.2022.3228199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978542","Conducted emission;cubic spline interpolation;dc–dc converter;equivalent circuit model;load effect;waveform decomposition","Load modeling;Noise measurement;Electromagnetic interference;Switches;Semiconductor device measurement;Mathematical models;Integrated circuit modeling","","2","","10","CCBY","9 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with other electrical machines, it has the advantages of high torque density and high efficiency for high speed operation. However, because of its complex irregular structure, the manufacturing process using silicon sheets is complicated. Soft magnetic composite material (SMC) is manufactured by powder metallurgy technology, which can produce various shapes of stator core structures, so it is easier to produce various irregular shapes of the stator core. However, the raw SMC material is relatively expensive, and the mechanical strength of SMC is weak. In this paper, a PMCPM with hybrid cores is proposed. With the adoption of hybrid silicon sheet - SMC cores and amorphous alloy - SMC cores, the torque ability of PMCPM can be improved greatly and it can have higher efficiency for more wide operation frequency. Meanwhile, its mechanical strength has been improved and it can be designed for high torque direct drive applications as it is a modular machine. Furthermore, three methods are proposed to reduce the additional eddy current loss which resulted from the employment of hybrid cores in PMCPM.","2096-3564","","10.30941/CESTEMS.2023.00027","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52007047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10075353","Permanent magnet claw pole machine (PMCPM);Soft magnetic materials (SMC);Hybrid cores;Eddy current loss","Magnetic cores;Stator cores;Silicon;Metals;Magnetic flux;Torque;Amorphous magnetic materials","","2","","16","","16 Mar 2023","","","CES","CES Journals"

The integral value (IV) of blood oxygen signal was calculated as an indicator of cortical activation level and the whole brain correlation analysis was used to calculate cortical functional connectivity. The results showed that as motor fatigue deepened, the activation levels of bilateral DLPFC and PMC in early stage were significantly higher than those in later stage (P<0.05), and the functional connectivity strength of the motor related cortex areas between the hemispheres was significantly reduced, which was manifested by the functional connectivity strength of LSMC-RSMC and LPMC-RSMC showed a significant decrease in middle stage compared with that in early stage (P<0.05) and that the functional connectivity strength of LPMC-RSMC and RSMC-SMA showed a significant decrease in later stage compared with that in early stage (P<0.05).

"Analysis of an Internal Electrical Short in an LHC Orbit-Corrector Magnet","E. Ravaioli; A. Verweij; M.

These circuits can be ramped up to their nominal current, however their superconducting magnets quench when they are ramped down using the same ramp-rate. Furthermore, after the quench the measured circuit current increases above its initial value for a few tens of milliseconds. This transient is analyzed with the STEAM-LEDET program, which allows multiphysics transient simulations including electro-magnetic coupling between the turns, 3-dimensional thermal diffusion in the coil windings, ohmic loss, and inter-filament coupling loss. Simulation results show that this atypical magnet behavior can be fully explained by an internal turn-to-turn short. In fact, due to the strong magnetic coupling of the shorted turn to the rest of the coil, whenever the magnet transport current is changed, a current-change with opposite polarity is induced in the shorted turn. During circuit ramp-down, the current through the shorted turn reaches values significantly higher than in the rest of the coil. The simultaneous increase of the superconductor current density due to the induced current and of its temperature due to local ohmic loss in the short can lead to a quench. Subsequently, the current in the shorted turn rapidly reduces, and its energy transfers by inductive coupling to the rest of the coil, causing a temporary increase of its current.

This brings additional challenges when it comes to quench protection. At CERN, a fast quench protection system is under development that introduces normal zones directly in the coil's conductor by inductive heating. This system is called External coil Coupled Loss Induced Quench (E-CLIQ). The E-CLIQ device comprises many small copper coils that are strategically placed near the main coils. Once a quench is detected, a capacitor is discharged in to the E-CLIQ coils, resulting in the characteristic damped oscillating current of an RLC circuit. This results in a large, but local applied dB/dt on the conductor of the main magnet system, which locally heats it by induced interfilament and interstrand coupling loss. Such a system has the advantage of being fast by introducing normal zones in potentially less than 10 ms, it doesn't rely on heat flow through the insulation layers of the coil, as is the case with traditional quench heaters, and it is not electrically connected to the main circuit. In this paper, the E-CLIQ system is introduced, several first demonstrator coils are presented and the results of a first proof-of-concept test are shown.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3258912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076805","E-CLIQ;coupled loss;quench protection;inductive heating;LTS magnets","Superconducting magnets;Magnetomechanical effects;Capacitors;RLC circuits;Magnetic circuits;Wires;Discharges (electric)","","2","","16","CCBY","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two radiating patches are placed in different layers to create the two distinct resonances and the bottom patch which is shorted to the ground by four metal posts acts as the ground for the top patch antenna. A metal wall is introduced between LB feeding probes to enhance the polarization isolation to more than 25 dB. Complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) structures are etched on the feedlines to improve the cross-band isolation to over 25 dB. Based on this antenna element, a  $1\times 4$ -element linear array is constructed with SRR-loaded baffles positioned between adjacent elements to suppress the mutual coupling.

For accuracy and stability of the FDTD method, the computational domain of EM problems with locally fine structures or electrically small objects is discretized with finer grids. This sub-gridding algorithm for different regions of the computational domain was implemented to increase the accuracy and reduce the computational time and memory requirements compared to those of the traditional FDTD method. In the sub-gridding algorithm, the FDTD computational domain is divided into separate regions: coarse grid and fine grid regions. Since the cell sizes and time steps are different in the coarse and fine grid regions, interpolations in both time and space are used to evaluate the electric and magnetic fields on the boundaries between different regions. The accuracy of the developed 3D sub-gridding algorithm has been verified for radiation and scattering problems, including multiple fine grid regions. Excellent performance is obtained even for higher and different contrast ratios in fine grid regions.","2836-8282","","10.23919/emsci.2023.0034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433553","Finite-difference time-domain method;Sub-gridding algorithm;Temporal and spatial interpolations","Interpolation;Three-dimensional displays;Memory management;Electromagnetic scattering;Time-domain analysis;Electromagnetics;Finite difference methods","","2","","20","","13 Feb 2024","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

Timely treatment of intravenous immunoglobin is needed to prevent coronary artery aneurysm formation, but KD is usually diagnosed when pediatric patients are evaluated by a clinician in the emergency department days after onset. One or more of the five clinical signs usually manifests in pediatric patients prior to ED admission, presenting an opportunity for earlier intervention if families receive guidance to seek medical care as soon as clinical signs are observed along with a fever for at least five days. We present a deep learning framework for a novel screening tool to calculate the relative risk of KD by analyzing images of the five clinical signs.

Furthermore, the auxiliary slot structure was investigated to improve the efficiency of heat dissipation. The heat dissipation capacity of the auxiliary slot was further enhanced by analyzing various shapes of auxiliary slots.

The bathymetry, the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance ( $K_{d}$ ), and the particulate backscattering coefficient ( $b_{\text {bp}}$ ) are important metrics in monitoring water quality in lakes and have typically been measured in two ways: 1) via in situ sampling campaigns, which are expensive, time-consuming, and have a low spatial resolution; and 2) via passive optical imagery, which can have errors in excess of 50%. Recently, Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESAT-2), an active light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based satellite, has proven effective in deriving the bathymetry,  $K_{d}$ , and  $b_{\text {bp}}$  in the global oceans. However, validation of such metrics has never been done on satellite flyovers taken on the same day as in situ measurements. Likewise, studies on freshwater environments have been limited. Here, we compare in situ data sampled from Lake Michigan and Big Glen Lake between August 13th and 14th, 2021, and results derived from an ICESat-2 flyover in the same region on August 14th, 2021. We find excellent agreement between the in situ values and the satellite-derived values for all three metrics.

For instance, the k-induction implementation in CPACHECKER, an award-winning framework for program analysis, uses invariants produced by a configurable data-flow analysis to strengthen induction hypotheses. This invariant generator, CPA-DF, uses arithmetic expressions over intervals as its abstract domain and is able to prove some safe verification tasks alone. After extensively evaluating CPA-DF on SV-Benchmarks, the largest publicly available suite of C safety-verification tasks, we discover that its potential as a stand-alone analysis or a sub-analysis in a parallel portfolio for combined verification approaches has been significantly underestimated: (1) As a stand-alone analysis, CPA-DF finds almost as many proofs as the plain k-induction implementation without auxiliary invariants. (2) As a sub-analysis running in parallel to the plain k-induction implementation, CPA-DF boosts the portfolio verifier to solve a comparable amount of tasks as the heavily-optimized k-induction implementation with invariant injection. Our detailed analysis reveals that dynamic precision adjustment is crucial to the efficiency and effectiveness of CPA-DF. To generalize our results beyond CPACHECKER, we use CoVeriteam,a platform for cooperative verification, to compose three portfolio verifiers that execute CPA-DF and three other software verifiers in parallel, respectively. Surprisingly, running CPA-DF merely in parallel to these state-of-the-art tools further boosts the number of correct results up to more than 20 %.

In this study, the performances of traditional methods: discrete wavelet transform (DWT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), independent component analysis (ICA), and principal component analysis (PCA); and their corresponding feature networks based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework: ScatNet (wavelet scattering network), DCTNet, ICANet, and PCANet, were investigated for use in pressure-based footstep recognition when the limited sample size is available for person authentication.

Among them, compound planetary reducers can be effectively used in robots because they can achieve high gear ratios with smaller volume. The design of conventional reducers comprises the method of setting a gear ratio to design the gear dimensions and calculating efficiency through dynamic analysis. However, this method suffers from repeated designing and analysis, which makes it very time-consuming. Therefore, this study defines the problem of reducer design as the problem of optimization by setting an objective function, constraints, and boundary conditions, and proposes to obtain the results in a short period of time using the Sequential Least Squares Programming(SLSQP) method. Using the SLSQP method, optimization results can be obtained as real numbers, making it suitable for use in compound planetary friction reducers with no constraints on the selection of gear dimension. For the design problem of the conventional compound planetary gear reducer in which the module value exists, an additional optimal design method considering the module is proposed.

Despite the potential for myoelectric signals to reflect the users’ intentions more accurately than external sensors, current motorized prosthetic legs fail to utilize these signals, thus hindering natural control. A reason for this challenge could be the insufficient accuracy of locomotion detection when using muscle signals in activities outside the laboratory, which may be due to factors such as suboptimal signal recording conditions or inaccurate control algorithms.This study aims to improve the accuracy of detecting locomotion during gait by utilizing classification post-processing techniques such as Linear Discriminant Analysis with rejection thresholds. We utilized a pre-recorded dataset of electromyography, inertial measurement unit sensor, and pressure sensor recordings from 21 able-bodied participants to evaluate our approach. The data was recorded while participants were ambulating between various surfaces, including level ground walking, stairs, and ramps. The results of this study show an average improvement of 3% in accuracy in comparison with using no post-processing (p-value < 0.05). Participants with lower classification accuracy profited more from the algorithm and showed greater improvement, up to 8% in certain cases.

With this approach we obtained an average power of up to 802 W at a wavelength of λ = 1030 nm in the IR-VB with a pulse energy of 802 µJ, a pulse duration of 460 fs, and a mode-conversion efficiency of 90.1%. By subsequent second harmonic generation, the IR-VB was frequency-doubled inside a lithium triborate (LiB3O5) crystal. An average power of up to 320 W at λ = 515 nm was generated, with 320 µJ of pulse energy, 382 fs of pulse duration, and an IR-VB to SH-VB conversion efficiency of 39.9%. The generated IR and VIS VBs were characterized by a Mach-Zehnder type interferometric measurement, confirming the helical wavefronts at these high average powers.

Random rotations of the high-order mode-field distribution at the distal end can produce large coupling losses at the multimode waveguide grating coupler (MWGC) in the fiber-chip interface. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by using a novel approach based on controlling the relative phases and amplitudes of different modes launched at the proximal end of the fiber. We implemented an integrated mesh of Mach Zehnder Interferometer at the transmitter to demonstrate control of the distal end mode field distribution to ensure low coupling losses in the receiver's MWGC. The MWGC on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform had measured coupling efficiency of (−5.7 dB, −7.1 dB) for (LP01x, LP11ax) modes, without needing any manual adjustment to align the mode orientation with the MWGC. The coherent Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) network can be dynamically controlled to produce the desired mode pattern at the distal end of the FMF to enable low-loss coupling at the distal end. This enables the practical deployment of mode division multiplexing with MWGC without needing manual control of fiber orientation at the receiver. The proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that the transmitter mode control is suitable for future deployment of mode division-multiplexing (MDM) data center interconnects.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3305778","RGC GRF(grant numbers:14203620); Innovation and Technology Commission; ITF Talent Hub Scheme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10221692","Integrated optics;coherent network;few mode fibers;space-division multiplexing","Optical waveguides;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber couplers;Couplings;Optical fibers;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber theory","","2","","37","CCBY","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, a novel unit protection scheme is proposed in this paper. From fault characteristics measured at substation (SS), AT station (ATS) and section post (SP), we can observe that SS protective relays can detect all the faults but could not be selective, and ATS or SP relays can discriminate the faulted line but not sensitively enough; therefore, we make full use of the fault characteristics and propose a novel unit protection scheme. We employ directional distance protections at SS, ATS and SP, and unify them with networked inter-tripping signals and interlocking signals. When a forward distance protection detects a fault and does not receive inter-locking signals from reverse distance protections of other relays in a short setting time, it will trip the relevant circuit breaker and send an inter-tripping signal to other relays in the same protection unit. Field test results show the proposed scheme trips only the faulted line rapidly and never interrupts the power supply of healthy lines; therefore, the proposed protection scheme obtains both selectivity and speed.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.02830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9877989","All-parallel AT railway system;distance protection;unit protection","Relays;Circuit faults;Circuit breakers;Rail transportation;Current measurement;Impedance measurement;Impedance","","2","","20","","5 Sep 2022","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

Metal coplanar waveguides (CPWs) are fabricated that employ graphene as a shunt between the signal and ground planes. The CPWs are used for characterizing the frequency-dependent behavior of the sheet resistance of the graphene shunt from 10 MHz to 10 GHz. The process involves evaluating the CPW’s RLCG transmission line parameters and comparing them to a reference un-shunted CPW to extract the sheet resistance. We find that the quality of the metal contact with graphene is one key parameter to observe adequate current injection in the 2D material in the RF spectrum. A mild argon plasma treatment was applied to reach an adequate contact quality. Furthermore, we observe a monotonic decrease of the sheet resistance of the epitaxial graphene for frequencies roughly above 100 MHz. We attribute this behavior to the progressively smaller influence of small-scale discontinuities, such as grain sizes, at those higher frequencies.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2022.3230358","Australian Research Council through the Centre of Excellence in Transformative Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS)(grant numbers:CE200100010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991963","Coplanar waveguides;contact resistance;graphene;radio frequency;sheet resistance","Graphene;Coplanar waveguides;Metals;Resistance;Substrates;Epitaxial growth;Contact resistance","","2","","18","CCBY","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, such low-cost instruments have a lower sampling rate than the pixel clock in VDUs; pixel information is lost in the image reconstructed from the measured EM waves, and the quality of the image is also degraded. In this letter, we propose a novel method to reconstruct high-quality images from lower sampling rate observations by a nonnegative linear optimization. Our method can recover clear images even when measuring EM leakage at low sampling rates and fluctuating sampling clocks. To obtain a stable and plausible solution to the optimization problem, we focus on fluctuations in sample points caused by clock jitter in devices and instruments and use pixel information obtained by observing multiple frames. To verify the proposed method, we generated simulated data from leaked EM waves, including screen information, and evaluated the visibility of the reconstructed images. Consequently, the images reconstructed using the proposed method were of the same quality as those reconstructed by applying conventional methods to data measured at a high sampling rate sufficient for information recovery. Moreover, we confirmed that even if the image quality is degraded by a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed signal and an increase in the clock jitter, the proposed method can still be used to obtain high-quality reconstructed images by increasing the number of observed frames.","2637-6423","","10.1109/LEMCPA.2023.3301431","JST FOREST Program(grant numbers:JPMJFR206L,JPMJFR206I); JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:19H01104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10201909","Compromising emanation;convex optimization;electromagnetic (EM) information leakage;hardware security;remote visualization of screen images;TEMPEST","Image reconstruction;Clocks;Instruments;Signal to noise ratio;Optimization;Jitter;Fluctuations","","2","","8","CCBY","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter is sensitive to surface roughness and can provide large-scale estimates of road surface roughness. In this letter, a semiempirical model for estimating road surface roughness using high-resolution spaceborne X-band SAR datasets from Germany’s TerraSAR-X (TS-X) satellite is proposed for the first time. The method is capable of handling the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spaceborne SAR. To enhance the reliability of the results obtained from rather low SNR datasets, techniques, such as SNR thresholding, multi-dataset fusion, and automatic road extraction, were implemented.

The proposed method focuses on the Sboxes of the first three rounds of AES continuously and obtains the secret key by sequentially estimating the intermediate values using a first-order SCA. Our method can be applied to all versions of the Secure Onboard Communication (SecOC) standard for securing CAN protocols. We apply a deep-learning-based SCA to implement the proposed attack, in addition to conventional correlation power analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack through an experiment using AES-CMAC software that is implemented on the PASTA automotive security evaluation platform, which is compliant with the SecOC standard that is defined in the AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture.

While major advances have been made in early intervention for the treatment of patients post stroke, the majority of survivors have residual mobility challenges. Recovery of motor function is dependent on the interrelationship between dosing, intensity, and task specific practice applied during rehabilitation. Robotic exoskeleton (RE) based gait training utilizes progressive repetitive task-oriented movements to promote functional recovery. The purpose of this investigation was to demonstrate the utilization of intensity modulated exoskeleton gait training on functional outcomes and walking speed post stoke. Preliminary data is presented for individuals diagnosed with stroke who received RE gait training. The intensity modulated RE gait training was delivered by a physical therapist and participants trained at 75-85% of calculated max heart rates at each session, over 10 weeks (30 sessions). After 10 weeks of training participants increased walking speed (10 meter walk test) and functional measures (timed up and go, berg balance assessment, dynamic gait index and functional ambulation category). These preliminary results demonstrate the utilization of intensity modulated gait training for improved functional ambulation and motor recovery using a robotic exoskeleton overground gait training post stroke.Clinical Relevance— Preliminary data provides initial evidence for intensity modulated exoskeleton gait training as a therapeutic intervention post stroke.

Eight capacitors are connected in series with the isolating resistors of each section. After capacitive loading, isolation between WPC input ports is significantly improved at low frequency. Consequently, the operating bandwidth of WPC has been increased from 13:1 to 31:1. Compared with the conventional Wilkinson combiner with the same bandwidth, the proposed WPC reduces the size by 40%. In addition, all the ports are well impedance matched and the insertion loss in the operating frequency band is less than 0.5 dB.

A common practice to mitigate speckle is to multilook the data prior to retrieving soil moisture. While multilooking indeed reduces speckle, it also decreases the spatial resolution and removes possibly useful high resolution information from the data. We, therefore, hypothesized that using higher resolution backscatter data for soil moisture retrieval would lead to higher retrieval accuracies. A high resolution field study combined with a synthetic experiment showed that calculating soil moisture prior to multilooking to the final target resolution calculate-then-average (CtA) has substantial advantages over the average-then-calculate (AtC) approach. Currently, the AtC strategy is most often applied in soil moisture studies, mainly due to its computational advantage compared to the CtA approach. We show that by making use of a higher source resolution backscatter data than the target resolution, we could improve soil moisture retrieval over an agricultural field.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3264732","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg (FNR)(grant numbers:PRIDE15/10623093–HYDRO-CSI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092867","High resolution;soil moisture;synthetic experiment","Soil moisture;Backscatter;Spatial resolution;Speckle;Synthetic data;Synthetic aperture radar;Standards","","1","","18","CCBY","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose extended analytical methods to estimate AC losses in non-uniform rotating magnetic fields. Our proposed methods can refine the AC loss estimation process and improve the subsequent cryogenic load design. The significant advantage of our proposed method is the ability to capture the impact of AC losses due to varying field magnitude within a single cycle. We estimate losses for various scenarios and compare them to FEA analysis results to verify the accuracy of our model. We then experimentally validate the FEA models used in the analysis for uniformly rotating fields, which establishes the feasibility of our proposed models.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3254487","NASA's University Leadership Initiative; Center for High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft(grant numbers:80NSSC19M0125); NSF(grant numbers:1807823); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064214","Superconducting;Ac loss;analytical models;finite element analysis;harmonics;power law;SC machines","Mathematical models;Analytical models;Harmonic analysis;Conductors;Magnetic fields;Windings;Atmospheric modeling","","1","","37","CCBY","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) device is capable of achieving energy and area efficient rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functionality. This work utilizes the SOT-MTJ based ReLU for activation and max-pooling in a single unit to eliminate the need of dedicated hardware for pooling layer. Moreover, 2 × 2 multiply-accumulate-activate-pool (MAAP) is implemented by using four activation pairs each of which is fed by the crossbar output. The presented approach has been used to implement various CNN architectures and evaluated for CIFAR-10 image classification.

As a consequence, its early diagnosis is of major importance for the improvement of life quality, implying that the severe symptoms can be delayed through appropriate clinical intervention and treatment. Among the most important premature symptoms of PD are the voice impairments of articulation, phonation and prosody. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the voice’s dynamic behavior can be used as possible indicator for PD. Thus in this work, we employ the recurrence plots (RPs) which derive from the analysis of the three modulated vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/, which belong to the PC-GITA dataset, and are fed as input images to a 3-channel Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) architecture, which, finally, differentiates the 50 PD patients from 50 healthy subjects.

The persistent back end for the ATLAS information system of TDAQ (P-BEAST) is a system based on a custom-built time-series database. It archives any operational monitoring data published online, resulting in about 18 terabyte (TB) of highly compacted and compressed raw data per year. P-BEAST provides command line and programming interfaces for data insertion and retrieval, including integration with the Grafana platform. Since P-BEAST was developed, several promising database technologies for efficiently working with time-series data have been made available. A study to evaluate the possible use of these recent database technologies in the P-BEAST system was performed. First, the most promising technologies were selected. Then, their performance was evaluated. The evaluation strategy was based on both synthetic read and write tests and on realistic read patterns (e.g., providing data to a set of Grafana dashboards currently used to monitor ATLAS).

In addition to being more cost-effective and easier to place without as much needed infrastructure, it has been publicized that the lower field strengths make MRI safer for patients with implants. To test this claim, we conducted a total of 368 simulations with wires of various lengths and geometries in a gel phantom during radiofrequency (RF) exposure at 23 MHz and 63.6 MHz (corresponding to MRI at 0.55 T and 1.5 T). Our results showed that heating in the gel around wire tips could be higher in certain cases at 0.55 T. To examine the impact on real patients, we simulated two models of patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants of different lengths. These simulations provide quantitative evidence that low-field MRI is not always safer, and this paper serves to illustrate some of the basic principles involved in RF heating of elongated implants in MRI environments.Clinical Relevance— This paper illustrates the physical concepts of resonance and inductive coupling in RF heating during MRI scanning with implants through systematic simulations and discusses the impact of these principles in practice.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340861","","Heating systems;Systematics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Wires;Satellite broadcasting;Implants;Brain modeling","Humans;Deep Brain Stimulation;Heating;Hot Temperature;Prostheses and Implants;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","1","","22","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel unobtrusive under-mattress optical tactile sensor for sleep position classification. The sensor uses a camera to track particles embedded in a soft silicone layer, inferring the deformation of the silicone and therefore providing information about the pressure and shear distributions applied to its surface.We characterized the sensitivity of the sensor after placing it under a conventional mattress and applying different weights (258 g, 500 g, 5000 g) on top of the mattress in various predefined locations. Moreover, we collected multiple recordings from a person lying in supine, lateral left, lateral right, and prone positions. As a proof-of-concept, we trained a neural network based on convolutional layers and residual blocks that classified the lying positions based on the images from the tactile sensor.We observed a high sensitivity of the optical tactile sensor: Even after placing the sensor below a conventional mattress, we were able to detect our lowest test weight of 258 g. Using the neural network, we were able to classify the four sleep positions, lateral left, lateral right, prone, and supine with a classification accuracy of 91.2 %.The high sensitivity of the sensor, as well as the good performance in the classification task, demonstrate the feasibility of using such a sensor in a robotic bed setup.Clinical Relevance— Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea is highly prevalent across the general population. Today’s gold standard treatment of using CPAP ventilation is often not accepted, leading to unwanted treatment cessations.

Space agencies rely on evidence-based approaches to maximise the impact of innovation and make it safe for use in space. However, a lack of human readiness levels delays the inclusion of humans in the technology development process and can prevent the identification of human health hazards. This creates difficulties for the commercial space sector when attempting to apply the government's evidence-based approaches. As a result, medical capabilities for spaceflight could be developed independently of operations and vehicle/system design.

Such skills belong to what is usually called common sense, which is essential to carry out an intervention. Although general common sense refers to all the basic concepts about the world and belongs to all human beings (e.g., the fact that a needle must be inserted from tip to eye), we believe that field-specific common sense is developed depending on individual experiences within a field of expertise. In surgery, field-specific common sense is the “glue” knowledge that is not explicitly described in surgical manuals, but it is acquired during lengthy surgical training. For example, a textbook does not explicitly describe how the needle should be held nor how it should be inserted in the human body, but this information is known by the domain experts. Understanding how to describe, represent, and learn this knowledge is paramount to developing robust and reliable autonomous robotic surgical systems (ARSSs). Developing ARSSs is a research trend of great interest for which taxonomies and paradigms have already been proposed. For more details, the reader is referred to [1] and [2].

However, some configuration choices, including window type and size, magnitude compression, as well as the distance between spectrograms, are often set implicitly, even though they can significantly impact the loss properties and the convergence of trained models. Particularly in the context of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), where learned parameters may explicitly control the frequency of synthesis components, the MSS loss often fails to provide informative gradients. The main goal of this letter is to gain a better understanding of how different configurations of the MSS loss affect this problem. As an illustrative example, we analyze the task of sinusoid frequency estimation via gradient descent to compare different configurations and their effect on the loss properties. Furthermore, we show that favorable configurations can also facilitate unsupervised training of a more complex DDSP additive synthesis autoencoder.

Electrical characteristics of the power devices get further improved thanks to the advanced carrier controllability. In this paper, a silicon-on-isolator lateral IGBT (SOI-LIGBT) featured four hybrid gates is proposed to obtain outstanding carrier controllability in turn-on, turn-off and short-circuit conditions for the first time. Four hybrid gates include three planar gates (G1, G2 and G3) and a trench gate (G4), of which G3 and G4 are grounded gate to lower saturation current and suppress latch up. Low turn-off time  $(t_{OFF})$ , di/dt and improved short-circuit withstanding capability are obtained through providing different input signals to these gates. In the turn-on, G2 is pre-charged to a stable voltage equal to gate voltage  $(V_{G1})$  to suppress the high di/dt before  $V_{G1}$  starts to rise. In the turn-off, a P-type inversion is induced by the negative voltage of  ${\mathrm{ G}}_{2}~(V_{G2})$ , which provides a low-resistance hole current path to extract the stored holes. In the short-circuit condition, G3 and G4 are both shorted to the ground to lower the saturation current and suppress the activation of parasitic NPN transistor, resulting in an improved short-circuit withstanding time  $(t_{SC})$ . Compared with the conventional SOI-LIGBT,  $t_{OFF}$  and di/dt are reduced by 43.6% and 53.08%, and  $t_{SC}$  is prolonged from  $3.04\mu \text{s}$  to  $8.89\mu \text{s}$  at DC bus voltage of 400V.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2023.3274133","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62274032,62174029); Distinguished Young Scholars Program, Southeast University(grant numbers:2242022R40010); Technological Achievements of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BA2022005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121749","carrier controllability;turn-on;di/dt;turn-off time;short-circuit;short-circuit withstanding time;SOI;lateral IGBT;LIGBT;SOI-LIGBT","Logic gates;Controllability;Transient analysis;Resistance;Pulse measurements;Integrated circuit modeling;Insulated gate bipolar transistors","","1","","17","CCBY","9 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Promising performance results have been realized on AQFP processors; however, scaling these results to larger computing systems faces engineering challenges due to device density and power distribution. AQFP circuits require a multi-phase activation signal to propagate logic. If data is not properly aligned with the activation phase, it can be dropped or shifted to an incorrect phase and disrupt circuit operation. This work presents design and simulation of an activation phase synchronizer: a simple circuit that will accept data arriving on any phase and re-align it to a known phase of the subsequent cycle. The phase synchronizer can be useful for mitigating clock skew across clock domains or play an important role in asynchronous design where the arrival time of data may be unknown.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2023.3243186","MIT Lincoln Lab(grant numbers:ACC 767); DARPA and the Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8650-19-2-7921); Center for Bits and Atoms consortium; Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering(grant numbers:FA8702-15-D-0001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040715","Superconducting logic circuits;superconducting devices;superconducting integrated circuits;Josephson junctions;asynchronous logic","Synchronization;Electronics packaging;Couplings;Mathematical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Inductors;Clocks","","1","","20","CCBY","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we investigate the feasibility to predict the outcome of KCNQ2 patients via Electroencephalogram (EEG). By using the combination of deep networks and classical classifiers, the abnormal brain pathological activities recorded in EEGs can be encoded into deep features and decoded into specific KCNQ2 outcomes, thus taking the advantage of both powerful feature extraction capability from deep networks and stronger classification ability from classical classifiers. Specifically, we acquire 10-channel EEG signals from 33 infants with KCNQ2 pathogenic variants after taking ASMs. Two well-trained models (Resnet-50 and Resnet-18) are employed to extract deep features from the EEG spectrums. We achieve an accuracy of 78.7% to predict the KCNQ2 outcome of each infant.

Existing MMML fusion strategies use static modality weight assignment, based on the intrinsic value of sensor modalities determined during the training phase. However, input data perturbations in practical scenarios affect the intrinsic value of modalities in the inference phase, lowering prediction accuracy, and draining computational and energy resources. In this letter, we present dynamic fusion (DynaFuse), a framework for dynamic and adaptive fusion of MMML inference to set modality weights, considering run-time parameters of input data quality and sensor energy budgets. We determine the insightfulness of modalities by combining the design-time intrinsic value with the run-time extrinsic value of different modalities to assign updated modality weights, catering to both accuracy requirements and energy conservation demands. The DynaFuse approach achieves up to 22% gain in prediction accuracy and an average energy savings of 34% on exemplary MMML applications of human activity recognition and stress monitoring in comparison with state-of-the-art static fusion approaches.","1943-0671","","10.1109/LES.2023.3298738","NSF Smart and Connected Communities (S&CC)(grant numbers:CNS-1831918); Nokia Foundation; Kaute Saatio; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261977","Energy efficiency;multimodal machine learning (MMML);run-time systems","Monitoring;Energy consumption;Predictive models;Stress;Data models;Computational modeling;Human activity recognition","","1","","11","CCBY","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The training set and the testing set for the ELM are built based on our experimental system parameters. After dataset training, the ELM model for mono-exponential decay extraction is obtained. In the dataset testing, this model gives almost the same results with the LM algorithm. The relative deviation of precision is only about ±1 nanosecond. This ELM model can also be directly used in experimental cavity ring-down system. Comparing with the LM algorithm, the relative deviations are less than ±2 nanoseconds when the decay time is in the range of 0.98 μs∼2.20 μs.

However, due to the no or limited internal control details, the state-space modeling method cannot be realized. It leads to the ACPES system becoming a black-box dynamic system. The dynamic modeling method based on deep neural network can simulate the dynamic behavior using port data without obtaining internal control details. However, deep neural network modeling methods are rarely systematically evaluated. In practice, the construction of neural network faces the selection of massive data and various network structure parameters. However, different sample distributions make the trained network performance quite different. Different network structure hyperparameters also mean different convergence time. Due to the lack of systematic evaluation and targeted suggestions, neural network modeling with high precision and high training speed cannot be realized quickly and conveniently in practical engineering applications. To fill this gap, this paper systematically evaluates the deep neural network from sample distribution and structural hyperparameter selection. The influence on modeling accuracy is analyzed in detail, then some modeling suggestions are presented.

There are many therapeutic applications where VNS could be used as a therapy, such as cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, depression, and inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular applications are particularly relevant, since cardiovascular diseases are the top causes of death worldwide. VNS clinical trials have been performed in the last 15 years for the treatment of heart failure (HF), achieving controversial results. Typically VNS is applied with a cuff electrode placed around the nerve, in an open-loop or cardiac synchronized design. The effectiveness of this approach is hindered by the multifunctional nature of the VN, which is involved in a variety of homeostatic controls. When a high current is applied, adverse effects arise from the stimulation of undesired fibers. An alternative strategy is represented by intraneural stimulation, which can guarantee higher selectivity. Moreover, closed-loop modalities allow the delivery of electrical current inside the nerves only if needed, with a reduced risk of untargeted nerve activation and lower energy consumption. Here we propose a closed-loop intraneural stimulation of the right cervical VN in a clinically relevant animal model. The intraneural was designed according to the internal structure of the VN. A threshold-based closed-loop algorithm was developed using HR as a control variable to produce a chronotropic effect.Clinical Relevance—This work analyzes the closed-loop intraneural VNS for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, and supports the possibility of developing fully implantable devices with a high degree of selectivity in stimulation and prolonged lifespan.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340798","","Heart rate;Energy consumption;Modulation;Epilepsy;Implants;Optical fiber devices;Hemodynamics","Animals;Cardiovascular Diseases;Heart;Vagus Nerve;Heart Failure;Autonomic Nervous System","1","","22","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Known factors that contribute to variations in the magnitude of RF heating across patients include the implanted lead’s trajectory and its orientation with respect to the MRI electric fields. Currently, there are no consistent requirements for surgically implanting the extracranial portion of the DBS lead. Recent studies have shown that incorporating concentric loops in the extracranial trajectory of the lead can reduce RF heating, but the optimal positioning of the loop is unknown. In this study, we evaluated RF heating of 77 unique lead trajectories to determine how different characteristics of the trajectory affect RF heating during MRI at 3 T. We performed phantom experiments with commercial DBS systems from two manufacturers to determine how consistently modifying the lead trajectory mitigates RF heating. We also presented the first surgical implementation of these modified trajectories in patients. Low-heating trajectories included small concentric loops near the surgical burr hole which were readily implemented during the surgical procedure; these trajectories generated nearly a 2-fold reduction in RF heating compared to unmodified trajectories.Clinical Relevance— Surgically modifying the DBS lead trajectory can be a cost-effective strategy for reducing RF-induced heating during MRI at 3 T.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340979","","Radio frequency;Heating systems;Magnetic resonance imaging;Satellite broadcasting;Deep brain stimulation;Surgery;Lead","Humans;Deep Brain Stimulation;Heating;Prostheses and Implants;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Phantoms, Imaging","1","","32","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These sensors often mount magnetically to a rotational component within a manufacturing system, such as the spindle in a computer numeric controlled (CNC) machining center, aimed at detecting signs of bearing failure through accelerometer measurements. To be affordable for small and medium enterprise (SME) manufacturers, sensors packs are often constructed from lower quality products with a high degree of performance variance. When a sensor pack is replaced with nominally identical components, variance in sensitivity, axis rotation, and scaling results in a different frequency response under the same operating conditions. Measurement variance results in challenges for anomaly detection models trained on previous data that are applied to the replacement sensor system. This research investigates a method to calibrate low-cost accelerometer based IoT sensors using the CNC manufacturing system itself. A reference point is created with the first sensor installed on the machine. A second replacement sensor is installed before the reference sensor is disposed and measurements are compared against the first sensor to calculate scaling, rotational shift, and sensitivity variance coefficients. The resulting correction factor is applied to the second sensor, reducing the effect of measurement variations between devices. The results of this work increase the consistency and reliability of acceleration measurements across different low-cost IoT sensors by providing a calibration method leveraging the manufacturing system itself, assisting in the adoption of low-cost IoT technologies for SMEs.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324512","","","","1","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Several studies demonstrate that pulse oxygen saturation estimated from photoplethysmography (PPG) introduces a racial bias due to the more profound scattering of light in subjects with darker skin due to the increased presence of melanin. This leads to an overestimation of blood oxygen saturation in those with darker skin that is increased for low blood oxygen levels and can result in a patient not receiving potentially life-saving supplemental oxygen. This racial bias has been comprehensively studied in conventional finger pulse oximetry but in other less commonly used measurement sites, such as in-ear pulse oximetry, it remains unexplored. Different measurement sites can have thinner epidermis compared with the finger and lower exposure to sunlight (such as is the case with the ear canal), and we hypothesise that this could reduce the bias introduced by skin tone on pulse oximetry. To this end, we compute SpO2 in different body locations, during rest and breath-holds, and compare with the index finger. The study involves a participant pool covering 6-pigmentation categories from Fitzpatrick's Skin Pigmentation scale. These preliminary results indicate that locations characterized by cartilaginous highly vascularized tissues may be less prone to the influence of melanin and pigmentation in the estimation of SpO2, paving the way for the development of non-discriminatory pulse oximetry devices.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341069","Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341069","","Pulse oximeter;Fingers;Estimation;Skin;Pulse oximetry;Pigmentation;Blood","Humans;Skin Pigmentation;Racism;Melanins;Oximetry;Oxygen","1","","11","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The procedure often involves implanting two elongated leads aimed at specific brain nuclei in both the left and right hemispheres. However, evaluating the safety of MRI in patients with such implants has only been done on an individual lead basis, ignoring the possibility of crosstalk between the leads. This study evaluates the impact of crosstalk on power deposition at the lead tip through numerical simulation and phantom experiments. We used CT images to obtain patient-specific lead trajectories and compared the power deposition at the lead tip in cases with bilateral and unilateral DBS implants. Our results indicate that the RF power deposition at the lead tip can vary by up to 6-fold when two DBS leads are present together compared to when only one lead is present. Experimental measurements in a simplified case of two lead-only DBS systems confirmed the existence of crosstalk.Clinical Relevance—Our results indicate that RF heating of implanted leads during MRI can be affected by the presence of another lead in the body, which may increase or decrease the power deposition in the tissue depending on the position and configuration of the leads.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340769","","Radio frequency;Heating systems;Power measurement;Magnetic resonance imaging;Satellite broadcasting;Crosstalk;Implants","Humans;Heating;Deep Brain Stimulation;Prostheses and Implants;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Computer Simulation","1","","27","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For authentication that is used daily and long-term by general consumers, the wrist is a suitable location, which could be easily integrated into the existing form of smartwatches and fitness trackers. However, current EMG-based biometrics still follow the historical path of powered prosthetics research, where EMG signals were usually recorded from forearm positions. Moreover, the robustness of EMG processing algorithms across multiple days is still an open problem that needs to be addressed before for long-term reliable use. This study intends to investigate the difference in authentication performance between wrist and forearm EMG signals, in a within-day and two cross-day analyses. Our open dataset (GRABMyo dataset) was used to examine this difference, which contains forearm and wrist EMG data collected from 43 participants over three different days with long separation (Days 1, 8, and 29). The results showed wrist EMG signals led to at least comparable with forearm EMG signals in within-day Equal-error rate (EER). In cross-day analysis, the EER of the wrist EMG signals was higher than that of forearm signals. In general, the low median EER (<0.1) of wrist EMG in cumulative cross-day analysis demonstrates the promise of using wrist EMG signals for authentication in long-term applications.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340339","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340339","","Wrist;Biometrics (access control);Authentication;Electromyography;Robustness;Biology;Security","Humans;Wrist;Forearm;Electromyography;Wrist Joint;Biometric Identification","1","","16","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although moisture is considered to the key factor leading to temperature rise in high humidity areas, the specific position and diffusion path of the moisture are unclear for the newly-installed composite insulators. In this paper, the microstructure analysis and the moisture absorption test are firstly conducted to find the specific position of the moisture. Also, an accelerated water penetration test is used to demonstrate the influence of the moisture on the temperature rise. The former experiments find that the moisture is concentrated at the voids near the interface and the surface of the Aluminum hydroxide (ATH) particles in the housing material. For the newly-installed composite insulator, the moisture could spread to the voids through the failed fitting sealing and the interface bonding, however, the permeation through the housing is invalid. The later test finds that the moisture at the surface of ATH could increase the temperature at the high-voltage end and the moisture in the void could lead to an additional heating area outside the high-voltage end. The temperature rise of additional heating area is dependent on the length of the unbonded interface next to the fitting. According to the result of finite element simulation, the additional heating area is caused by increase of electric field strength at both ends of the moisture area. The additional heating area outside the high-voltage end could be used as the feature of the sealing and the bonding defect of newly-installed composite insulators.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2021.09110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026225","Composite insulation;Dielectric heating;Failure analysis;Inference mechanisms","Moisture;Temperature measurement;Insulators;Heating systems;High-voltage techniques;Transmission line measurements;Moisture measurement","","1","","","","25 Jan 2023","","","CSEE","CSEE Early Access Articles"

The prepared device with a gate length of 450 nm has a unit current gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 31.5 GHz, a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 46.3 GHz, and a three-terminal OFF-state breakdown voltage (BVgd) of 140 V at the gate-drain distance of  $2.3~\mu \text{m}$ .

Furthermore, a significant suppression of the current collapse (~5.7%) is observed due to the electric field redistribution near the drain region.

The idea is to use existing components without having to change their implementation, while still adjusting the precision of the abstraction using the successful CEGAR approach. The approach of cegar-pt is largely general: It only restricts the abstraction to transform, given a precision that defines the level of abstraction, one program into another program. The abstraction by program transformation can over-approximate the data flow (e.g., havoc some variables, use more abstract types) or the control flow (e.g., loop abstraction, slicing).

Based on the measured refractive-index of splice with different arc-fusion parameters, the influence of the Tm-doped pedestal splice on laser propagation was analyzed using the beam propagation method (BPM). The simulation results indicate that optimizing the arc-fusion parameters can improve the efficiency of laser coupling into the fiber core at the splice. Experimental comparisons were made to assess the impact of different arc-fusion parameters on laser performance. By optimizing arc-fusion parameters of the TDFL, the near-periodic power degradation is reduced effectively. A hundred-watt-level all-fiber TDF setup was established. Compared to the initial splice, the optical conversion efficiency increased from 39.6% to 48.4% and the beam quality factor M2 was reduced from 10.55 to 2.17 in the horizontal direction and from 11.89 to 2.26 in the vertical direction.

The dominant supermodes are found by a complex waveguide mode simulation and can be identified by the number and arrangement of side-lobes of their Fourier-transformed far-field beam profiles. The supermode with all three elements in-phase is found to possess the minimum central lobe angular divergence.

We show that the array can be adjusted to lase in a desired supermode by varying the injection currents into each element of the array.

However, for processes where the mass concentration and the moisture content of the material can vary, it is not possible to distinguish between the two effects based on capacitive measurements alone. This letter shows how permittivity and conductivity measurements can be used to independently determine the mass concentration and the moisture content of a powder. The proposed method is demonstrated for an exemplary coal powder. A dielectric characterization based on impedance measurements of a coaxial probe is carried out.

For this reason, the devices must be worn around the neck or somewhere on the body, which causes limited mobility and can lead to inaccurate research results. Therefore, this work presents a fully integrated and functional hearing aid research platform that weighs only 5 grams and can be worn behind the ear. The platform is high-level programmable, features wireless technologies such as near-field magnetic induction (NFMI) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and integrates two micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones and an external speaker. The audio processor of the system is based on a new custom, low-power 22nm mixed-signal system on chip (SoC). Different real-world use cases, like a dynamic compressor, are used to evaluate the platform. With a total power consumption of 47 mW, the rechargeable device achieves a run-time of six hours. When the wireless interfaces are turned off, the power consumption drops to 31 mW, and the run-time increases to nine hours.Clinical relevance—The proposed research hearing aid demonstration platform can be used portable and outside the clinical setting for algorithmic research.

However, many populations express their emotions differently from what is considered ""typical"". Previous literature has indicated a possible relationship between emotion and eye-movement. The objective of this paper is to further explore this proposed relationship by identifying specific features of eye-movement that relate to six emotion categories: joy, surprise, indifference, disgust, sadness, and fear. Features of eye-movement are extracted from measurements of pupil diameter, saccades, and fixations. These measurements are collected as participants view images from the International Affective Picture System, a validated image deck used to evoke known levels of pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Example features of eye-movement measurements such as pupil diameter include maximum or minimum values, means, and standard deviations. Statistical analyses indicate that the extracted features of eye-tracking in this paper can identify fear and sadness with relative accuracy, while more work is needed to differentiate among joy, indifference, disgust, and surprise. Future work aims to understand differences between typically developing populations such as the individuals included in this analysis, and clinical populations such as individuals with cerebral palsy.Clinical Relevance— This pilot study suggests a link between emotion and features of eye-movement. The information will later be used to develop assistive communication devices that better meet the self-expression needs of individuals with motor and communication challenges.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340178","","Atmospheric measurements;Statistical analysis;Sociology;Gaze tracking;Feature extraction;Particle measurements;Object recognition","Humans;Pupil;Eye-Tracking Technology;Pilot Projects;Emotions;Fear","1","","19","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key idea of this work is to subtract retroreflections in unwanted directions by partially trimming the aperture of CRs, allowing control over the radar crosssection (RCS) when looked at from different angles. We developed a geometric analysis based on the effective area of CRs to determine the appropriate aperture trimming for the desired angular characteristics. This method can append direction selectivity to various CR-based chipless RFID tags. We demonstrate a trimmed CR-based spatially coded chipless RFID that can present different 4-bit IDs in three different directions while maintaining a large RCS of 1.80 dBsm. The proposed method can artificially code the selective reflections in passive reflectors and is suitable for the applications requiring large detectability, such as outdoor landmarks and signs.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2023.3294940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182363","Chipless radio frequency identification (RFID);corner reflector (CR);millimeter-wave radar (mmWave);radar crosssection (RCS)","Apertures;Radar cross-sections;Optimized production technology;Radar;Analytical models;Method of moments;Azimuth","","1","","17","CCBYNCND","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aortic (central) pressure features are associated with cardiovascular complications and can be algorithmically derived from non-invasive peripheral arterial waveforms. This has conventionally been performed with a pressure waveform (i.e., tonometry or oscillometry) rather than with the optical-based sensor (photoplethysmography (PPG)) that is predominantly used in wearable health devices. Extraction of aortic features from a peripheral PPG waveform has yet to be investigated. This study aims to compare aortic features extracted from peripheral arterial waveforms acquired with different sensor modalities using the same transfer function. Design and Method. Radial tonometry (reference), finger volume-clamped PPG (Peňáz) and fingertip PPG waveforms were measured in participants (n=29, 36±16 years, 15 female) under baseline conditions. Waveforms were converted into an aortic pressure waveform using the transfer function. Waveform features were extracted from the converted waveform. Extracted features were compared with correlation plots and a Bland-Altman analysis. Results. Aortic pressure features extracted from a finger using the Peňáz technique were comparable to radial tonometry derived features. Aortic features extracted from a fingertip waveform were more variable in comparison to radial tonometry-derived features. Conclusions. Aortic (central) pressure waveform features contain valuable haemodynamic information and have the capacity to be easily and conveniently implemented in wearable health devices. Future use of these features in wearable health devices incorporating PPG requires the development, and/or, optimization of a unique transfer function to more accurately represent the aortic pressure waveform for cardiovascular assessment.Clinical Relevance— Aortic pressure features might be used in wearable health devices following the development of a unique transfer function for optical-transduced peripheral vascular signals.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340434","","Wearable computers;Volume measurement;Fingers;Transfer functions;Estimation;Feature extraction;Photoplethysmography","Humans;Female;Arterial Pressure;Blood Pressure;Arteries;Hemodynamics;Aorta","1","","6","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, which condition can induce the activation is still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify brain activation conditions using 40 Hz monaural beat (MB). Under this stimulation, auditory sense status which is determined by frequency and power range is the condition to consider. Hence, we designed five sessions to compare; no stimulation, audible (AB), inaudible in frequency, inaudible in power, and inaudible in frequency and power. Ten healthy participants underwent each stimulation session for ten minutes with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. For analysis, we calculated the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG for each session and compared them in frequency, time, and five brain regions. As a result, we observed the prominent power peak at 40 Hz in only AB. The induced EEG amplitude increase started at one minute and increased until the end of the session. These results of AB had significant differences in frontal, central, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions compared to other stimulations. From the statistical analysis, the PSD of the right temporal region was significantly higher than the left. We figure out the role that the auditory sense is important to lead brain activation. These findings help to understand the neurophysiological principle and effects of auditory stimulation.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340294","Korea University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340294","brain modulation;monaural beat;sense;electroencephalogram","Brain;Time-frequency analysis;Frequency modulation;Statistical analysis;Electroencephalography;Biology;Recording","Humans;Brain;Electroencephalography;Hearing;Acoustic Stimulation;Brain Mapping","1","","20","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerical modelling has shown that these anomalies can be explained by an inhomogeneous degradation in the Rutherford cable, in which a subset of strands is fully or partially degraded. In this paper, we study how this type of degradation can affect the early stages of quench propagation.

However, excessive elevation of blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes and serious complications such as arteriosclerosis. Even though blood sugar levels as well as hypoxia associated with hyperglycemia are known to be closely related to diabetes complications, the responses of vascular endothelial cells to glucose and oxygen have not been fully investigated. In this study, using a microfluidic device that can control the oxygen concentration, we observed the behavior of vascular endothelial cell monolayers while simultaneously controlling glucose and oxygen levels. Results showed that the cell migration speed was increased by high-glucose exposure in an oxygen-rich environment, but was decreased in a hypoxic environment regardless of glucose condition. The expression of vascular endothelial-cadherin at the cell periphery, which plays a role in cell-cell adhesion, was increased by hypoxic exposure, but was largely independent of glucose condition. This suggested that cell-cell adhesion is less involved in the increase in migration caused by high glucose. Furthermore, stabilization and nuclear translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, which is involved in cellular hypoxia sensing, increased 5 h after exposure to high glucose, but decreased 3 days after the exposure. This indicated that intracellular hypoxia was generated by increased oxygen consumption in mitochondria just after the high-glucose exposure, but it was moderated within 3 days.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340043","","Adhesives;Hypoxia;Glucose;Behavioral sciences;Diabetes;Biosensors;Biomedical monitoring","Humans;Oxygen;Glucose;Endothelial Cells;Blood Glucose;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A;Hypoxia;Cell Movement","1","","10","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clinically, patients with left USN commonly demonstrate a striking immediate capture of attention from ipsilesional, right-sided items as soon as a visual scene unfolds (i.e., magnetic attraction [MA]). Therefore, this preliminary study utilized a three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment to evaluate the effects of eliminating stimuli in the rightward space and directing attention to the left on neglect symptoms. Methods: Seven patients with USN participated in this study, and two types of visual stimuli were created: the numbers and objects in the 3D virtual environment. To eliminate the visual stimuli on the right side, a moving slit was introduced in the virtual environment. During the experiment, patients were required to orally identify each object and number both in moving and nonmoving slit conditions. Results: A statistical comparison of scores with and without the moving slit in the 3D virtual space indicated significant changes in the object stimuli condition; however, no statistically significant difference was observed in the number stimuli condition. Conclusions: Masking the right side within the 3D virtual space increased the number of objects that can be recognized on the left side by patients with USN. The results may allow interventions in a virtual reality environment that closely resembles the patient’s real-life space.Clinical Relevance—Magnetic attraction is a symptom seen in patients in clinical practice, but there is no method of rehabilitation.

Therefore, the present cross-eye jamming systems are hard to jam frequency-agile radar or multi-band radar, whose carrier frequency covers a large spectral range. In this paper, a photonic-assisted broadband radio frequency (RF) cross-eye jamming system is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. To achieve effective jamming effect, the intercepted radar signal is modulated to optical carriers and the phase shift is realized by optical spectrum processing. The relationship between system parameter tolerances and jamming effects are also simulated. Furthermore, the RF transfer function of X-band, Ku-band and K-band has been obtained in the experiments.

The results concluded that the perception ability of the brain declined with the acceleration of the object's moving speed and that the brain recognized the detailed information of the moving object when its speed was lower than 0.46 m/s.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010098","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601028,61431007); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002505); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906054","electroencephalography (EEG);N400;perception ability;moving object","Semantics;Electroencephalography;License plate recognition;Videos","","1","","27","","29 Sep 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Using a near-field apertured probe, in collection mode, we demonstrate the generation and detection of such phenomenon. By analyzing the momentum components of the obtained near-field images, it is demonstrated that the detected signal is mostly composed of near-field components.

In the here and now, C-band based optical coherent receiver frontends would be a cost-effective solution to support bandwidth division multiplexing without the need for bespoke and expensive per band receiver designs. To investigate a potential use of already existing C-band receivers for multi-band applications, we present a simple and rapid measurement method to characterize the quadrature phase error and the electrical output swing. We experimentally characterize four different commercially available C-band receivers from the upper E- to lower U-band covering 25.4 THz (i.e. 200 nm) of total bandwidth. The obtained results reveal that micro-optics based discrete 90° hybrids and discrete indium phosphide (InP) balanced photodetectors are promising candidates for multi-band systems.

Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric materials exhibit high piezoelectric constants and lightweight properties, which makes them promising candidates for high-performance smart RF-based tunable structures. Therefore, there is a need for characterizing piezoelectric materials relevant to their applications to predict their response during such operations. In this work, a combined electrical and light-based methodology to characterize the voltage dependency profile of  $\mathrm {d}_{33}$  is developed. A set of equations are extracted based on the electrical capacitance and light profilometer analysis. These equations are then used to compute the effective  $\mathrm {d}_{33}$  numerical values. PZT thin film of  $1~\mu \text{m}$  has been sandwiched between two electrodes and poled with the application of 20 volts/  $\mu \text{m}$  to demonstrate the power of the current approach. The voltage-based capacitance and change in area of the sample were collected at different DC biases. The numerical values obtained by the existing conventional methods lie in the computed range obtained by the current technique. It is worth adding that it is quite difficult to absolutely decide which method produces the most representative numerical values due to the substrate clamping effect, probing, resolutions, and accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3295784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184304","Characterizations;electrical capacitance;light measurements;MEMS;piezoelectric coefficient;PZT","Capacitance;Voltage measurement;Capacitance measurement;Optical interferometry;Dielectric constant;Electrodes;Piezoelectric devices","","1","","26","CCBYNCND","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, the model incorporates an attention module which can analyze image sensitivity based on different channel and spatial information, thus effectively focusing on areas with rich steganographic signals.

However, relevant experiments showed that a large proportion of photo-generated carriers can escape from MQWs sandwiched in the p-type layer and n-type layer (PIN structure), but not in the NIN structure. In order to study this phenomenon carefully, we applied positive and negative bias to an NIN structure respectively to simulate the PIN structure. By analyzing the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, we observed a weak escape behavior of photon-generated carriers among QWs in NIN structure. The experiment results indicate that strong electric field could drive carriers to escape from QWs rather than relaxation and recombination, while in NIN structure the inhomogeneous distribution of the electric field intensity reduces the carrier transport efficiency. The further study will give new ideas to design and produce photoelectric devices.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3269082","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3201904); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62005138); Qilu University of Technology(grant numbers:2022PX080); Qilu University of Technology(grant numbers:2022GH001); Qilu University of Technology(grant numbers:2021YY01002); Shandong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2020QF098,ZR2022QF115); Project of Jinan(grant numbers:202228032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106420","Escape;multi-quantum wells;NIN structure","Electric fields;Pins;Radiative recombination;Quantum well devices;Doping;Potential well;Gallium arsenide","","","","22","CCBY","21 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Timely surgical intervention can ameliorate the condition in stable hips and reduce future cases of osteoarthritis and total hip replacement. However, current definitions of DDH are subjective, and thus would benefit from a more objective and reliable assessment metric. Since the shape of the femoral head and its congruence with the acetabulum are disrupted by DDH, analysis of the femoral head could potentially play a role in the development of novel objective morphological metric for stable DDH. Therefore, this paper aimed to segment the paediatric femoral head in stable hips from radiographs, which has not been attempted before in the chosen focus age group (1-16 years) where the pelvis and hip joint undergo significant development. Two techniques were compared against a baseline U-Net: data augmentation and region-of-interest (ROI) networks. Four models were developed either without, with just one, or with both techniques. Evaluated using tenfold cross-validation, the U-Net trained with both techniques achieved the best results, with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.951±0.037 (mean ± standard deviation, calculated with 720 images). Future work will use this segmentation algorithm to accurately characterise hip joint morphology and estimate the benefit of early surgical intervention in DDH.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340016","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340016","","Measurement;Pediatrics;Image segmentation;Head;Shape;Surgery;Morphology","Infant;Humans;Child;Child, Preschool;Adolescent;Hip Dislocation, Congenital;Femur Head;Hip Joint;Acetabulum;Radiography","","","22","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The majority of solutions suggested by current literature use sophisticated deep learning techniques for the identification of human emotions. These models are very complex and need huge resources to implement. Hence, in this work, a method for human emotion recognition is proposed which is based on much simpler architecture. For that, two publicly available datasets SEED and DEAP are used to perform experiments. First, the EEG signals of the two datasets are segmented into epochs of 1second duration. The epochs are also decomposed into different brain rhythms. The features computation is performed in two different ways, one is directly from the epochs and the other way is from the brain rhythms obtained after the decomposition of the epochs. Several features and their combination are examined with different classifiers. For the DEAP dataset baseline features are also utilised. It is observed that the support vector machine (SVM) has shown the best performance for the DEAP dataset when baseline feature correction and epoch decomposition are implemented together. The best achieved average accuracy is 96.50% and 96.71% for high versus low valence classes and high versus low arousal classes, respectively. For the SEED dataset, the best average accuracy of 86.89% is achieved using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 2 hidden layers.Clinical relevance— This work can be further explored to develop an automated mental health monitor which can assist doctors in their primary screening.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341106","","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Biological system modeling;Multilayer perceptrons;Brain modeling;Feature extraction","Humans;Electroencephalography;Emotions;Brain;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","","","17","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is largely due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable ABP measurements in the MRI environment. Here, we propose a combined experimental and mathematical modeling framework to estimate ABP fluctuations inside the MRI scanner using photoplethysmography (PPG).

Clinical assessments of social skills have found that reduced heart rate variability is related to differences in the development of social skills in children and increase the risk of mental disorders. Limited by widespread manual signal processing and R-peak detection in current clinical assessments, most literature reports only short-term baseline studies, with fewer studies reporting social interaction settings with prolonged recording. There is an urgent need for an automated physiological signal processing toolbox to detect R-peaks and perform heart rate variability measurements in social settings. This paper proposes a modified automated Neurokit2 toolbox with signal processing procedures similar to the MindWare software that requires manual inspection of R-peak locations. We calculate time domain heart rate variability metrics from the publicly available QT database by PhysioNet collected at resting states and under stress tests, mimicking social interaction stress scenarios. Statistical analysis conveys that heart rate variability metrics calculation applying both signal processing approaches using the Neurokit2 toolbox are statistically equivalent in comparison to the hand-labelled R-peaks from the QT database (n= 10 in the normal sinus rhythm group, and n= 6 in the ST Change group). Such validation results are crucial for the adoption of automated toolboxes for heart rate variability measures in social interaction assessments, where more movement and mood changes of participants are expected.Clinical Relevance— This contributes to the body of evidence of the reliability of the Neurokit2 toolbox for automatic cleaning of prolonged cardiac electrophysiological signals and calculation of heart rate variability in time-domain characterization in social interaction stress assessment.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341110","","Databases;Current measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Manuals;Human factors;Electrocardiography;Inspection","Child;Humans;Heart Rate;Reproducibility of Results;Software;Electrocardiography;Arrhythmias, Cardiac","","","15","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, we observed altered NDTs and evoked potentials (EPs) in response to IES on the hands of PSPS-T2 patients.

In AC motor control, the maximum speed of the motor is limited by the output voltage capability of the traditional three-phase inverter with star connenction of windings. Switching the star connection to delta connection in high-speed range can extend the speed range. In order to extend the speed operation region, star-delta switch proposed by many literatures relies on mechanical relay, which needs a dead zone of tens of milliseconds and seriously affects torque output. Besides, the traditional method will cause current overshoot during the switch transient process, decreasing the device security and reliability. Aiming at the defects existing in the star-delta hard switching, this paper proposes a star-delta soft switching method. Without adding extra power electronics devices, DC-bus capacitor is used to provide the path of zero axis current in the transient process, which helps to achieve the smooth torque output and zero current switch in the transient. Experiments have been done to validate the performance of the proposed method.

The measurement is typically performed with four electrodes, two of them driving an alternating current through the tissue and the other two sensing the resulting voltage. Issues with the measurement setup such as stray capacitance or electrode mismatch can cause artifacts that impact Cole parameters used for volume estimation. While previous research has focused on mitigating high frequency artifacts, little research has been done to understand the cause and impact of low frequency artifacts, nor how to mitigate the impact of these artifacts. These artifacts are most prevalent in wearable segmental bioimpedance systems, especially using textile electrodes, so future research in this area is needed for these systems to be viable. The present study uses simulations to identify the potential sources of low frequency artifacts, and explores techniques to minimize the impact of these artifacts on Cole parameters. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the mismatch of the voltage electrodes causes artifacts at low frequency. These artifacts are highly dependent on the impedance of the negative current injecting electrode. Averaging measurements of the mismatch of both voltage electrodes and limiting high frequency measurements to 200 kHz can reduce errors due to these artifacts from over 137% to less than 3%. The results of this study suggest the impact of low frequency artifacts can be significantly reduced, enabling future development of wearable bioimpedance systems.Clinical relevance— Reducing the impact of low frequency artifacts on Cole parameter estimation enables wearable segmental bioimpedance systems that can be used for remote monitoring of volume status in home environments.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340666","","Electrodes;Voltage measurement;Current measurement;Volume measurement;Measurement uncertainty;Bioimpedance;Frequency estimation","Artifacts;Electric Impedance;Electrodes;Electric Capacitance;Textiles","","","11","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The PVT is a convenient tool that can be used in real time in situ through a mobile device without the assistance of experts and therefore can be used to improve safety and prevent accidents. However, the original PVT is vulnerable to the subject’s intentional concentration on the test, and the variance range among tests is narrow; these factors limit its usefulness in classifying the level of fatigue. This study overcome these limitations and develop the Psychomotor Cognition Test (PCT) by transforming the PVT into a tool that stably classifies fatigue levels, still requiring a short period of time. In the PCT, compared to the PVT, reaction time is significantly longer, and success rate is significantly lower (both p<0.0001). Whereas reaction time and success rate of the PVT do not show a significant correlation with fatigue level, those of the PCT show significant correlations with fatigue level, respectively (p<0.001).

Biomarkers such as amyloid beta are specific and sensitive in identifying AD and can identify individuals who have biological evidence of the disease but have no symptoms, but clinicians and researchers may not easily use them on a large scale. Ocular biomarkers, such as those obtained through eye tracking (ET) technology, have the potential as a diagnostic tool due to their accuracy, affordability, and ease of use. In this study, we show that eye movement (EM) metrics from an interleaved Pro/Anti-saccade (PS/AS) ET task can differentiate between cognitively normal (CN) and MCI subjects and that the presence of Aβ brain deposits, a biomarker of AD, significantly affects performance on these tasks. Individuals with Aβ deposits (Aβ+) performed worse than those without (Aβ-). Our findings suggest that eye-tracking measurements may be a valuable tool for detecting amyloid brain pathology and monitoring changes in cognitive function in CN and MCI individuals over time.Clinical Relevance— The PS/AS paradigm, which measures saccadic eye movements, can accurately detect subtle cognitive impairments and changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease in CN and MCI individuals.

The truncated patch is fed by the aperture etched on the ground plane. Firstly, a  $y$ -axis directional rectangular slot is introduced in the truncated patch to excite two orthogonal modes for left hand circular polarization(LHCP). Then an  $x$ -axis directional rectangular slot is employed to obtain right hand circular polarization (RHCP) performance. After that, one parasitic stub is loaded in the central of the  $x$ -axis directional rectangular slot, thus, an extra RHCP can be realized. Finally, the other parasitic stub is loaded beneath the truncated patch to improve the impedance and axial ratio performances. The etched slots and loaded stubs technologies are used in a single radiating patch to realize different senses at three different operating bands. And the senses and operating bands can be controlled by tuning according slots and stubs. Consequently, a compact triple-band dual-sense circularly polarized antenna is successfully designed. The 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidths of the proposed antenna are 2.6% (3.55-3.64 GHz), 0.24% (4.175-4.185 GHz), and 0.47% (4.26-4.28 GHz), respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3273114","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515110217); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001407,U2241222); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115407","Triple-band;circularly polarized;patch antenna;stub;slot","Polarization;Bandwidth;Substrates;Slot antennas;Impedance;Dielectric substrates;Patch antennas","","","","19","CCBYNCND","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dose covering 95% of the target was greater than or equal to 90% of the prescribed physical dose, and the BED were defined as the PDM and BDM, respectively. The BCF was created as a function of the DPF. The PDM and BDM for all DPFs were larger with the point prescription method than with the marginal prescription method. The marginal prescription method with a 60% isodose line had a larger PDM and BDM. The BCF with the point prescription was smaller than that with the marginal prescription in the left–right (LR), anterior–posterior (AP) and cranio–caudal (CC) directions. In the marginal prescription method, the 60% isodose line had a higher BCF. In conclusion, the improved BCF method could be converted to BDM for point prescription with 3DCRT and marginal prescription method with VMAT, which is required for stereotactic radiation therapy in radiobiology-based treatment planning.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrac097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091850","stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT);biological dosimetric margin (BDM);biological conversion factor (BCF);marginal prescription method;point prescription method","","","","","","","3 Apr 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, RTM based on full matric capture (FMC) data is limited by the time cost of the calculation and cannot be widely used. In this study, a new strategy of RTM using a plane wave is proposed. Plane wave reverse time migration (PWRTM) does not need to stack the imaging results from multiple sources and directly uses the plane wave as a source function to reconstruct the image domain, reducing the influence of numerical dispersion in PWRTM. Low-rank finite difference (LRFD) is used in wavefield simulation, the core idea of LRFD is to use the quasi differential operator to compensate the error of time steps in conventional finite difference. Mathematical derivation proves that the algorithm can be considered as analytical in homogeneous background velocity. We use the LRFD method to drive the elastic PWRTM in nondestructive testing, and the vector decomposition method is used to ensure that the phase and amplitude characteristics of the P- and S-wave are not distorted. In our simulation, compared with the scalar imaging algorithm based on the Helmholtz method, the proposed imaging algorithm can more efficiently and accurately image large angle defects.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3294288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177904","Reverse time migration (RTM);plane wave;nondestructive test;low-rank finite difference (LRFD)","Imaging;Finite difference methods;Numerical models;Mathematical models;Dispersion;Transforms;Surface waves","","","","17","CCBYNCND","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study presents a promising approach using a group of Embedded Instruments (EIs) inside a processor core for health monitoring. Multiple health monitoring datasets obtained from the employed EIs are sampled and collated via the implemented experiment and thereafter used for conducting its remaining useful lifetime prognostics. This enables MP-SoCs to undertake preventive self-repair, thus realizing a zero mean downtime system and ensuring improved dependability.

Those methods assign higher measurement rates to salient regions, but lower measurement rate to non-salient regions to improve the performance of CS imaging. However, those methods are block-based, which are difficult to apply to actual CS sampling, as each photodiode should strictly correspond to a block of the scene. In our work, we propose a non-uniform CS imaging method based on image saliency, which assigns higher measurement density to salient regions and lower density to non-salient regions, where measurement density is the number of pixels measured in a unit size. As the dimension of the signal is reduced, the quality of reconstructed image will be improved theoretically, which is confirmed by our experiments. Since the scene is sampled as a whole, our method can be easily applied to actual CS sampling. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we design and implement a hardware sampling system, which can apply our non-uniform sampling method to obtain measurements and re-construct the images. To our best knowledge, this is the first CS hardware sampling system based on image saliency.","2075-5597","","10.23919/cje.2019.00.028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038811","Compressive sensing;Non-uniform;Measurement density;Image saliency","Measurement units;Density measurement;Imaging;Image sampling;Size measurement;Hardware;Sensors","","","","25","","7 Feb 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

In this study based on a validated dataset of 183 videos from 92 premature infants (54 males, 38 females) born <33 weeks of gestational age (GA) and acquired between 32 and 40 weeks of GA, we introduce the mean 3D dispersion (M3D) for objective quantification and classification of normal and abnormal GMA.

Thus, a double-gap extractor with an operating mode of  $\pi $  mode is introduced to reduce the electric field in this type of device. The double-gap extractor can extract electron energy in two stages and lengthen the deceleration distance. Therefore, the electron beam loses less energy at the same deceleration distance in the double-gap extractor, and a weaker deceleration electric field is generated in the double-gap extractor. Additionally, the modulation electric field in the device with a double-gap extractor is stronger for modulating electrons and can further increase the fundamental harmonic current, resulting in higher extraction efficiency. In simulations, the output power is 6.3 GW and the maximum electric field strength is 1.06 MV/cm in the initial model with a single-gap extractor. When the single-gap extractor is replaced by the double-gap extractor, the output power increases to 6.5 GW with a conversion efficiency of 40% and a guiding magnetic field of 0.6 T.

To solve the problem, we propose a reconstruction error compensation neural network scheme (REC-NN) for a typical analytic MREPT method, Stab-EPT. Two NN structures: one with only ResNet blocks, and the other hybridizing ResNet blocks with an encoder-decoder structure. Results of experiments with digital brain phantoms show that, compared with Stab-EPT, and conventional NN based reconstruction, REC-NN improves both reconstruction accuracy and tissue contrast. It is found that, the encoder-decoder structure could improve the compensation accuracy of EPs in homogeneous region but showed worse reconstruction than only ResNet structure for tumorous tissues unseen in the training samples.

This paper presents a low-cost semantic engineering solution (ontology) to coordinate potential responses to disruption at the supply chain, factory and firm levels. The research method uses three cycles of design science research to develop a multi-level ontology and assess its potential to coordinate responses. The feedback from companies positions ontology as a solution for stress-testing next generation manufacturing systems. Using semantic engineering, companies can assess the available responses before disruptions, plan potential responses, and support their decision-making during demand fluctuation.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324808","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

First, in order to increase the out-of-band suppression, the NECC is proposed to produce an extra transmission zero (TZ) without introducing extra resonators, thus increasing the out-of-band suppression. Then, in order to facilitate the design process, the jigsaw puzzle shaped resonator structure is proposed. This resonator consists of several teeth structure along the outer edge of the resonators. The proposed structure not only enhances the coupling coefficient at the same coupling width, but also the coupling coefficient can be flexibly tuned by modifying the outer teeth structure without changing the relative positions of the resonators. The proposed filter is theoretically analyzed, full-wave simulated, manufactured and measured. The measured results are generally in good agreement with the simulated results. The proposed filter can be applied in the unlicensed millimeter wave region of the 5G wireless communication systems.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2023.3323412","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62301463); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0953); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274952","Near-end cross-coupling;jigsaw puzzle shaped resonator;on-chip band-pass filter;5G wireless communication system","Resonators;Resonator filters;Filtering theory;Couplings;Band-pass filters;Topology;System-on-chip","","","","14","CCBYNCND","10 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A low-cost Very Narrow Aisle pallet-racking vehicles (VNAs) utilisation monitoring solution developed for an English SME warehouse is presented as a case study. The presented solution has a direct business implication as the SMEs often rent VNAs. Quantifying the utilisation of the VNAs enables the SMEs to measure if, and identify how, the VNAs are, or can be, used to their optimal capacity. To that end, low-cost vibration sensors were deployed on the VNA bodies and wirelessly connected to Raspberry-Pi microprocessors via a local network. A state-of-the-art multilevel Bayesian classifier was deployed on the Raspberry-Pi to learn the statistical regions of operations of the corresponding VNA in real time. The data measured via the vibration sensor were classified as ''working'' vs ''idle'', to evaluate various utilisation metrics of the VNA. The solution was completed with an online UI for real-time stats and interaction with the warehouse staff. The classifier is also capable of cross-learning across the VNAs in case of sparse data, and can be expanded to multiple operating states.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324633","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This work reports patient-specific RF heating of both capped and uncapped abandoned epicardial lead configurations during MRI at both 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths. We found that leads routed along realistic, patient-derived trajectories generated substantially lower RF heating than the previously reported worst-case phantom experiments. We also found that MRI at the head imaging landmark leads to substantially lower RF heating compared to MRI at the chest or abdomen landmarks at both 1.5 T and 3 T.

However, large distribution centers run on the automated robots integrated with high-cost sensor system while small warehouses that cope with a large number of small-scale volumes rely on the manual work. The one of the critical aspects to be considered during loading task is the weight of baggage packed into boxes is and is measured by expensive built-in sensors. Typically, conveyor belts containing a weight scaler are used for assuring delivery quality in automated robot system supported by remote intelligent controller computer. This system needs too high installation cost to small warehouse. To reduce the cost, this paper proposed a method, sensor-integrated automation robot system is replaced to a low-cost sensory gripper with an attached intelligent module. Addressing this challenge, an innovative solution is proposed through the embedded artificial intelligence of low-cost sensors for a robotic gripper in a box handling process. The experiment of the prototype gripper shows that a quantized neural network is reduced into 11% size to be operated in a microcontroller attached on the robot, obtaining signals from two low-cost force sensing resistors. The resulting intelligent system encourages the use of sensory grippers embedded artificial intelligence in the industry and automation by identifying the weight of the gripping targets without the need for a separate process or expensive equipment.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324739","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Here we investigate the feasibility of using smart socks to stimulate the lower limbs of people with PD to reduce excessive step time variability during walking. We hypothesised that rythmic excitation of lower limb afferents, matched to a participant’s comfortable pace, would entrain deficient neuro-muscular signals resulting in improved gait. Five people with mild to moderate PD symptoms (70 ± 9 years) were tested on medication before and after a 30-minute familierization session. Paired t-tests and Cohen’s d were used to assess gait changes and report effect sizes. Participant experiences were recorded through structured interviews. Lower limb stimulation resulted in an acute 15% increase in gait speed (p=0.006, d=0.62), an 11% increase in step length (p=0.04, d=0.35), a 44% reduction in step time variability (p=0.03, d=0.91), a 22% increase in perceived gait quality (p=0.04, d=1.17), a 24% reduction in mental effort to walk (p=0.02, d=0.79) and no statistical difference for cadence (p=0.16). Participants commented positively on the benefit of stimulation during training but found that stimulation could be distracting when not walking and the socks hard to put on. While the large effects for step time variability and percieved gait quality (Cohen’s d > 0.8) are promising, limitations regarding sample size, potential placebo effects and translation to the home environment should be addressed by future studies.Clinical Relevance— This study demonstrates the feasibility of using smart stimulating socks to reduce excessive step time variability in people with PD.

Of all the causes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, airborne-droplet infection via coughing is the most common. Therefore, if predicting the onset of a cough and preventing infection were possible, it would have a globally positive impact. Here, we describe a new prediction and prevention system for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Usually, air is inhaled prior to coughing, and the cough, which contains droplets of the virus, then occurs during acute exhalation. Therefore, if we can predict the onset of a cough, we can prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. At Tohoku University, a diagnosis system for evaluating swallowing motions and peripheral circulation has already been developed, and our prediction system can be integrated into this system. Using three-dimensional human body imaging, we developed a prediction system for preempting the onset of a cough. If we can predict the onset a cough, we can prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, by decreasing the shower of virally active airborne droplets.

The MeSH annotation of a document consists of one or more descriptors, the main headings, and of qualifiers, subheadings specific to a descriptor. Currently, there are more than 34 million documents on PubMed, which are manually tagged with MeSH terms. In this paper, we describe a machine-learning procedure that, given a document and its MeSH descriptors, predicts the respective qualifiers. In our experiment, we restricted the dataset to documents with the Heart Transplantation descriptor and we only used the PubMed abstracts. We trained binary classifiers to predict qualifiers of this descriptor using logistic regression with a tfidf vectorizer and a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. We carried out a small-scale evaluation of our models with the Mortality qualifier on a test set consisting of 30 articles (15 positives and 15 negatives). This test set was then manually re-annotated by a cardiac surgeon, expert in thoracic transplantation. On this re-annotated test set, we obtained macroaveraged F1 scores of 0.81 for the logistic regression model and of 0.85 for the DistilBERT model. Both scores are higher than the macroaveraged F1 score of 0.76 from the initial PubMed manual annotation. Our procedure would be easily extensible to all the MeSH descriptors with sufficient training data and, we believe, would enable human annotators to complete the indexing work more easily.Clinical Relevance—Selecting relevant articles is important for clinicians and researchers, but also often a challenge, especially in complex subspecialties such as heart transplantation. In this study, a machine-learning model outperformed PubMed’s manual annotation, which is promising for improved quality in information retrieval.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340998","","Heart;Logistic regression;Vocabulary;Annotations;Training data;Surgery;Manuals","Humans;Medical Subject Headings;Abstracting and Indexing;PubMed;Information Storage and Retrieval;Machine Learning","","","11","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For finite element analysis (FEA) of spine, modelling a realistic intervertebral disc geometry has always been a challenge. This paper proposes a simple yet efficient workflow details for generating structured mesh of the ground substance of the AF and the method for generating collagen fibers with controllable angles that are embedded in AF.Clinical Relevance— The biomechanical response of spine is usually studied by finite element analysis (FEA) of the assembly of vertebra and IVD and other components. The FEA results are always dependent on the correct generation of the geometry and the material of the components.

Moreover, two kinds of consensus-based algorithms with the consideration of communication delays are encompassed to calculate the average values of static and dynamic variables and thereby build an effective communications network among DGs in dynamic MGs.

Nevertheless, existing freestanding radiation shields for anesthesiologists are typically simple, uncomfortable rectangles. Therefore, we devised a new perforated radiation shield that allows anesthesiologists and echocardiographers to access a patient through its apertures during SHD catheterization. No report of the relevant literature has described the degree to which the anesthesiologist's radiation dose can be reduced by installing radiation shields. For estimating whole-body doses to anesthesiologists and air dose distributions in the operating room, we used a Monte Carlo system for a rapid dose-estimation system used with interventional radiology. The simulations were performed under four conditions: no radiation shield, large apertures, small apertures and without apertures. With small apertures, the doses to the lens, waist and neck surfaces were found to be comparable to those of a protective plate without an aperture, indicating that our new radiation shield copes with radiation protection and work efficiency. To simulate the air-absorbed dose distribution, results indicated that a fan-shaped area of the dose rate decrease was generated in the area behind the shield, as seen from the tube sphere. For the aperture, radiation was found to wrap around the backside of the shield, even at a height that did not match the aperture height. The data presented herein are expected to be of interest to all anesthesiologists who might be involved in SHD catheterization. The data are also expected to enhance their understanding of radiation exposure protection.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrac106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091858","anesthesiologist;protection;radiation;structural heart disease (SHD);shield;simulation","","","","","","","3 Apr 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Behaviours prior to a suicide attempt have been identified, that could potentially be detected automatically. As a first step, the algorithm is required to accurately identify individuals exhibiting these behaviours in different settings. Our study analyses a human detection model focussing on pedestrian detection at railway stations as one component of a broader project to detect pre-suicidal behaviours. Closed-circuit television footage from two stations collected for the same 24-hour period were manually analysed to obtain parameters (true positives, false positives, and false negatives) which were then used to compute performance measures (sensitivity, precision, and F1 score). The model performed differently in both stations with a sensitivity of 0.73 and F1 score of 0.84 in Station A and a sensitivity of 0.48 and F1 score of 0.65 in Station B. Root causes of false negatives identified include differing body postures and occlusion. Although the model was adequate, its performance is dependent on the view captured by the cameras in stations. Collectively, these findings can be used to improve the model’s performance.Clinical Relevance—Detecting behaviours prior to a suicide attempt offers a critical period for intervention by bystanders or first responders, potentially interrupting the attempt. This offers the potential to directly reduce suicide attempts, as well as reduce third-party exposure to these traumatic events.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10339992","Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10339992","","Analytical models;Sensitivity;Pedestrians;TV;Computational modeling;Pipelines;Cameras","Humans;Suicide Prevention;Railroads;Suicide, Attempted;Suicidal Ideation;Risk Factors","","","21","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prototypes employ class-F harmonic termination which can eliminate almost loss due to harmonic generation and instead of one diode, using more diodes connected in parallel will reduce losses on the diode due to built-in potential voltage ( $V_{bi}$ ) and breakdown voltage ( $V_{br}$ ). The proposed methodology mechanism is analyzed and demonstrated by closed-form equations where the variation of the losses is clarified in the comparison. Furthermore, based on Schottky diode HSMS2850, two prototypes in two cases: a single diode and two parallel-connected diodes are designed at 0.915 GHz, and measured to compare the efficiency for methodology verification. The implementation results show that the PCE of two parallel-connected diode case is higher than the one of a single diode case when the highest PCEs of two parallel connected diodes are 78.3% in simulation and 73.2% in measurement while the corresponding PCEs of single diode case are only 75.3% and 70.7%.

To optimize the CMG for high output torque and low torque ripple, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify key size parameters that significantly influence the optimization objectives. Based on the sensitivity hierarchy of these parameters, a multi-objective optimization analysis is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal structural parameter values of the CMG. In addition, a coaxial magnetic gear (CMG) topology with 4 inner and 17 outer pole pairs is adopted, and the parametric model is established.

The sensor nodes take observations, quantize them, and send them to the fusion center through a network of relay nodes. The links in the network are assumed to satisfy certain capacity constraints in terms of the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted on the links. Furthermore, the relay nodes are assumed to satisfy flow conservation constraints, i.e., the number of bits flowing into a relay node is equal to the number of bits flowing out of it. It is shown that this flow optimization problem for estimation can be cast as a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem by suitably defining the utility functions at the sensors. The inference problem considered is one of parameter estimation with a linear observation model, which is studied in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings. Upper bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE) of optimal linear estimators are obtained in both settings, and these bounds are used to construct utility functions for the corresponding NUM problems. It is verified via simulations that the bit assignments at the sensors obtained through the solutions to the NUM problems, in both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings, yield considerably better estimation performance than the Max-Flow solution that simply assigns bits to the sensors in such a way as to maximize the total bits transmitted to the fusion center.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2023.3245540","Army Research Laboratory; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign through Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:W911NF-17-2-0196); Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044966","Flow optimization;sensor networks;statistical inference;Internet of Things","Optimization;Relays;Bayes methods;Estimation;Quantization (signal);Task analysis;Upper bound","","","","26","CCBY","15 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both NDT and PT measurements aim to characterize (parts of) the nociceptive system. To date it is unclear if, and if so to what extent, the two outcomes relate to one another. In this study, the primary aim is to explore the relationship between the two measures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As secondary aim, we explore differences in NDT between these RA patients with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) from a readily existing dataset. In total 46 RA patients have been recruited, whereby the pressure- (PPT; bilaterally at two locations) and electrical (EPT) pain threshold were evaluated, as well as the NDTs. Significant, positive correlations were found between the EPT and PPT (R=0.54-0.60), but not with the NDTs (R≤0.25). As compared to HC, higher NDTs were found in the RA group. As the presence of a statistically significant weak relationship can only be evaluated using a larger sample size, our results indicate that there is no moderate or stronger relation between PT and NDT outcomes. This implicates that the two outcomes are not strongly driven by the same (nociceptive) mechanism(s). Future research into NDTs and what factors and/or mechanisms affect the outcome, could yield relevant insights into how to use and interpret the results of this relatively new method.Clinical Relevance — The evaluation of nociceptive detection thresholds, in isolation or together with conventionally evaluated pain thresholds, might provide valuable and complementary insights into nociceptive (dis)function in man.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340755","","Correlation;Pain;Electric variables measurement;Arthritis;Biology;Pressure measurement","Humans;Pain Threshold;Nociception;Pain Measurement;Arthritis, Rheumatoid","","","26","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study first demonstrates the rectifying behavior on polycrystalline (poly) p-Ge on a glass substrate, using sputter-deposited ZrN contacts under 350 °C process. The rectifying characteristics depend on the poly-Ge quality derived from the grain size and the defect-induced acceptor density. The highest quality Ge is formed by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) of amorphous Ge deposited at 125 °C and exhibits the lowest reverse leakage current as well as the highest hole (the lowest electron) barrier comparable to a single-crystal Ge substrate.

However, how the user’s capability for multimanual coordination compares to bimanual coordination, and how the motor system decides to configure its limb contributions given task redundancy is unclear. We conducted bimanual and trimanual (with the foot as a third-hand controller) virtual reality visuomotor tracking experiments to study how 32 healthy participants changed their limb coordination in response to uninstructed cursor mapping changes. This used a shared cursor mapped to the average limbs’ position for different limb combinations. The results show that most participants correctly identified the different mappings during bimanual tracking, and accordingly minimized task-irrelevant motion. Instead during trimanual coordination, participants consistently moved all three limbs concurrently, showing weaker ipsilateral hand-foot coordination. These findings show how redundancy resolution and the resulting coordination patterns differ between similar bimanual and trimanual tasks. Further research is needed to consider the effect of learning on coordination behaviour.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340722","","Tracking;Redundancy;Virtual reality;Biology;Task analysis;Foot","Humans;Psychomotor Performance;Movement;Upper Extremity;Foot;Motion","","","23","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The necessary real-time monitoring of the load current is normally implemented by using external shunt resistors, yet the implementation of GaN-based isolated current sensor would be beneficial to the final power system in terms of space occupation as well as cost. This letter describes the implementation of two Hall-effect devices in p-type GaN (p-GaN) technology, which can potentially be used as integrated current sensors in GaN monolithic implementation.

There are many studies are dedicated to convert cold tumor to hot tumor for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this study, we suggested selective immune activation system through the spatiotemporal control of the bacteria as an immune boosting agent. To this end, we have developed bacteria-based micro/bio robot system (BBMBR) by attaching bacteria with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) so that the localization can be controlled through the magnetic field. The biomanufacturing results showed that BBMBR includes 6.6 ± 1.54 MNP attached and the presence ratio of bacteria-MNP out of total bacteria population reached 75.2 ± 3.37%. Spatial controllability experiments have shown that rotational and translation localization has been controlled as intended. The function of the immune modulation system through BBMBR was confirmed through experiments that magnetically driven BBMBR localization induced localized immune activation. M1-phenotype differentiation of macrophage cells were quantified CD80 staining, and overall immune response level was evaluated through IL-6 measurements. As the distance from the activation point increased, the population of M1 differentiated macrophages decreased, and when the movement of BBMBR was magnetically restricted, overall immune activation was found to be regulated downward. Proposed BBMBR and immune modulation framework could introduce a powerful new paradigm in cancer treatment by improving the localization controllability of immune-boosting agent and the spatial immune activation strategies.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340582","Korea Institute of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340582","","Location awareness;Microorganisms;Sociology;Modulation;Controllability;Magnetic fields;Statistics","Humans;Robotics;Neoplasms;Macrophages;Tumor Microenvironment;Bacteria","","","10","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation results show that in the solar wind plasma environment, the charging balance potential of solar panels is low and the charging difference between panels is small, which does not affect the normal operation of the satellite. However, when the satellite is in an hot plasma environment, if some parts of the satellite suddenly encounter extremely strong interference, the charging balance of the satellite in the solar wind plasma will be destroyed, and there will be a large potential difference between the irradiated part and the adjacent structure, which can easily cause electrostatic discharge to harm the normal operation of the satellite.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3235598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012350","plasma;GEO satellite;unequal charge effect;PIC algorithm","Satellites;Plasmas;Electric potential;Surface charging;Mathematical models;Space vehicles;Electrostatics","","","","","CCBY","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To explore this matter, we analyzed whether the cumulative mortality of irradiated mice could be explained by x-axis (age) shifted cumulative mortality of nonirradiated mice. We reanalyzed publicly available data on observed cumulative mortality or prevalence in irradiated female B6C3F1 mice that lived their entire lifespan. The results showed that the irradiated curve was well matched to uniformly shifted nonirradiated curve for the cumulative mortality of all causes of death but not for the cumulative mortality of all solid tumors and prevalence of ovarian tumors as is. After adjusting lifetime mortalities, it was also well matched for all solid and ovarian tumors. The shifted days by irradiation were 71–116 days for all causes of death, 56–135 days for all solid tumors, and 41–140 days for ovarian tumors in the 1.9 Gy-irradiated group. The response was switched between irradiation at 35 and 105 days consistently for all the above indexes, supporting the hypothesis that radiation sensitivity differs between juvenile and adults. The shifted days of all causes of death showed a tendency of linear response to dose. This concept of shifting the age of death can be applied not only for all cause of death but also for mortality of all solid tumors after adjusting the magnitude. These findings contribute to the discussion on the application of the ‘shifting age of death’ concept to radiation protection.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrad006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091866","shifting age of death;mice maintained for life;irradiation;all-cause mortality;tumor-related mortality;ovarian tumor","","","","","","","3 Apr 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

General-purpose SDC approaches such as Brotli reduce complexity by shipping the same dictionary for all use cases, while most delta encoding approaches just consider similarities between versions of the same entity (but not between different entities). In this study, we investigate how much of the potential benefits of SDC and delta encoding are left on the table by these two simplifications. As our first contribution, we describe the idea of cross-entity delta encoding that uses cached assets from the immediate browser history for content encoding instead of a precompiled shared dictionary; this avoids the need to create a custom dictionary, but enables highly customized and efficient compression. Second, we present an experimental evaluation of compression efficiency to hold cross-entity delta encoding against state-of-the-art Web compression algorithms. We consciously compare algorithms some of which are not yet available in browsers to understand their potential value before investing resources to build them. Our results indicate that cross-entity delta encoding is over 50% more efficient for text-based resources than compression industry standards. We hope our findings motivate further research and development on this topic. The extended version of our previously published paper [10] includes an additional section on the deltas of HTML files, a more detailed description of our approach (including a new visualization for the different dictionary strategies), a deeper discussion of compression efficiency, and details on additional future and ongoing work.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261476","Delta encoding;caching;dictionary compression","Industries;Visualization;Dictionaries;Encoding;Browsers;Complexity theory;History","","","","11","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

While industry adoption of modern information protocols has enabled machine connectivity, most process monitoring solutions require significant integration time, cost, and specialized expertise that are unobtainable for SMEs. This paper presents a low-cost machine monitoring architecture to provide SMEs the ability to gather performance related data from their machine and view its current performance with Google Sheets. The MTConnect standard, an open-source communication protocol used by many computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machining centers, is leveraged to contextualize and structure data. MTConnect data collected in this implementation contains information regarding the machine's production status, running program, axis loads, various manual overrides, and any alarms or errors raised from machine fault. The proposed no-cost architecture provides methods of permanent data storage, viewing of live machine performance, notification of machine errors or alarms, and visualization tools to graphically view machine performance over various periods of time. Furthermore, tradeoffs in computational and communication bandwidth are evaluated and discussed.

We applied a deep learning model, Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), to predict the participant’s decision accuracy by using their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as input. The classifier model demonstrated high accuracy, reaching 96.1% with an epoching time range of 500 ms following the stimulus event onset. The results revealed that the parietal-occipital brain region provides highly informative information for the classifier in the concealed visual searching tasks. Furthermore, the neural mechanism underlying the concealed visual-searching and decision-making process was explained by analyzing serial EEG components.

In this study, we proposed a method of identifying biomechanical parameters that predict posture-related pain in patients with lumbar spinal disc herniation. The pain values were quantitatively evaluated by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the biomechanical parameters were analyzed by OpenSim. Lasso regression was performed to narrow down the biomechanical parameters that were related to pain and derive the mathematical model of the relationship. Therefore, many of the parameters of the obtained mathematical model were related to the lumbar spine and were consistent with areas that be related to lumbar spinal disc herniation.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340117","Lumbar spinal disc herniation;back pain;OpenSim;Lasso regression","Biomechanics;Presses;Pain;Spine;Back;Mathematical models;Biology","Humans;Intervertebral Disc Displacement;Pain;Lumbar Vertebrae;Lower Extremity;Lumbosacral Region","","","22","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method avoids SNR loss in the process of estimating the frequency, thus reducing the SNR threshold. The simulation results show that the threshold is reduced by 5 dB compared with the discrete polynomial transform (DPT) method, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed estimator is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2023.000014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018322","linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal;time reversal;Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB);parameter estimation","Signal to noise ratio;Frequency estimation;Low-pass filters;Frequency modulation;Filtering;Chirp;Time-frequency analysis","","","","40","","16 Jan 2023","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

As the disease progresses, it is essential to compensate for the movement deterioration in patients.

Home-monitoring technologies can remotely deliver essential information to physicians and help them devise a treatment decision according to the patient’s need. Additionally, they help to observe the patient’s response to these changes. In this regard, we conducted a longitudinal study to collect gait data of patients with Parkinson’s disease while they received medication changes. Using logistic regression classifier, we could detect the annotated motor deterioration during medication optimization with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, an in-depth examination of the best features illustrated a decline in gait speed and swing phase duration in the deterioration phases due to suboptimal medication.Clinical relevance— Our proposed gait analysis method in this study provides objective, detailed, and punctual information to physicians. Revealing clinically relevant time points related to the patient’s need for medical adaption alleviates therapy optimization for physicians and reduces the duration of suboptimal treatment for patients.

However, most literature does not provide mechanisms to reason about, or respond to the attacks so that the system can continue to execute safely despite the intruder. This letter proposes a low-overhead methodology to automatically classify intrusions into predefined types once detected. Our framework: 1) groups messages of the same attacks into blocks; 2) extracts relevant features from each block; and 3) predicts the type of attack using a lightweight classifier model. The initial models depicted in this letter show an accuracy of up to 99.16% within the first 50 ms of the attack, allowing the system to quickly react to the intrusion before the malicious actor can conclude their attack.

It requires cross-staining comparison among Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of IHCs and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Currently, pathologists examine the visually co-localized areas across IHC and H&E glass slides for a final diagnosis, which is a tedious and challenging task. Moreover, visually inspecting different IHC slides back and forth to analyze local co-expressions is inherently subjective and prone to error, even when carried out by experienced pathologists. Relying on digital pathology, we propose ""Composite Biomarker Image"" (CBI) in this work. CBI is a single image that can be composed using different filtered IHC biomarker images for better visualization. We present a CBI image produced in two steps by the proposed solution for better visualization and hence more efficient clinical workflow. In the first step, IHC biomarker images are aligned with the H&E images using one coordinate system and orientation. In the second step, the positive or negative IHC regions from each biomarker image (based on the pathologists’ recommendation) are filtered and combined into one image using a fuzzy inference system. For evaluation, the resulting CBI images, from the proposed system, were evaluated qualitatively by the expert pathologists.

Adaptive beamforming for the multiple desired signals is realized by the improved Capon method. At the same time, the sidelobe constraint is added to reduce the sidelobe level. To reduce the pointing errors of multiple desired signals, the array response phase of the desired signal is firstly optimized by using auxilary variables while keeping the response amplitude unchanged. The whole design is formulated as a convex optimization problem solved by the branch-and-bound algorithm. In addition, the beamformer weight vector is penalized with the modified reweighted $l_{1}$-norm to achieve sparsity. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has lower sidelobe level, higher SINR, and less pointing error than the state-of-the-art methods in the case of a single expected signal and multiple desired signals.","1004-4132","","10.23919/JSEE.2022.000123","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2021YFB3502500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940247","multiple desired signal;auxiliary variable;branch-and-bound algorithm;reweighted-norm","Array signal processing;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Covariance matrices;Sensor arrays;Numerical simulation;Numerical models","","","","26","","4 Nov 2022","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

This sample was subjected to the highly accelerated temperature and humidity stress. Initially, we estimated the built-in electric field strength from the Franz-Keldysh oscillations. We found that the built-in electric field strength is enhanced after the acceleration stress. Next, we performed the numerical analysis of the built-in electric field strength as a function of probe-light power density. From the above-mentioned numerical analysis, we clarified that the surface recombination velocity of the top undoped GaAs epilayer is enhanced by a factor of two. In contrast, the surface Fermi level is hardly changed.

In the presence of phase errors, increasing the number of elements does not necessarily reduce the BER. In contrast, muting certain IRS elements can improve BER. However, solving the optimization problem heuristically is extremely complex because it requires evaluating BER expressions numerically for an enormous number of cases. Consequently, a long shortterm memory (LSTM)-based element selection (ES) technique is proposed to reduce the substantial complexity inherent in the conventional solution. A supervised learning approach with offline training is adopted where the decision of ES is made based on the phase estimation error parameter j.

We were able to reduce the thickness of the TEENI threads that are to be located in nerve tissue from ~10 μm to ~2.5 μm in total thickness. To maintain the handleability needed during the assembly of the TEENI device into the hydrogel-based scaffold, we maintained full thickness elsewhere in the TEENI device and added support rails. During longitudinal reactive-accelerated-aging (RAA) experiments performed over 6 days and at 67°C, which corresponds to ~48 days in tissue, we observed that some channels maintain a stable impedance and others do not. Although analyses performed using a scanning electron microscope could clearly reveal delamination in some channels that exhibited large changes in impedance, it did not always correlate. Some channels with significant changes in impedance did not exhibit any observable delamination.

Due to the lack of high-angle scattering, the achieved resolution is limited to several nanometers. Small-angle scattering allows researchers to reveal high-resolution 3D structures of specimens by fitting 1D diffraction signals. However, prerequisite 3D models and non-unique solutions restrict the potential to image general specimens. Under the assumption of an ensemble containing large amounts of identical specimens with the same orientation, the intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern of the whole ensemble is approximated to the form factor of a single specimen multiplied by the number of identical specimens. Since the diffraction intensities are contributed from the whole ensemble, the signal can be significantly extended to high-frequency regions. The feasibility of ensemble diffraction microscopy (EDM) was demonstrated by a designed sample using both totally and partially coherent X-ray sources at Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). The reconstructed images show excellent consistency with the image of a scanning electron microscope.

However, non-ideal FMF connections may break the weakly-coupled condition and be a great challenge for practical applications. Previous studies have shown that beam expansion methods may be effective for coupling loss suppression at non-ideal single-mode connections, but their effectiveness has seldom been discussed for non-ideal FMF connections as far as we know. In this article, we firstly investigate two typical beam expansion methods for the suppression of modal crosstalk and coupling loss induced by fiber misalignment or air gap at FMF connections by simulations, and the simulation results show that not all the methods are effective. The Dolph-Chebychev (DC) taper method could achieve significant performance improvement, while the gradient-index (GRIN) lens method may even degrade the performance of FMF connections. Then the beam expansion method is experimentally verified utilizing tapered two-mode fiber (TMF) connectors, which are fabricated with thermally-expanded-core (TEC) processing. The measurement results show that compared with the untapered case, the tapered TMF connectors show higher tolerance to misalignment and can achieve no less than 7.7 dB crosstalk reduction and 0.65 dB loss reduction when the misalignment at the connection is 2 μm.

GaN-based micro-LEDs are the most promising for high-density pixel applications. However, it is necessary to simultaneously fabricate full-color R/G/B emitters on a single substrate. Moreover, the efficiency droop at long wavelengths with high-indium InGaN still remains a challenge. The InGaN nanorod has the potential to realize monolithic R/G/B LEDs on a single substrate, and the Al reflector has a light reflectance that can dramatically improve light extraction efficiency. Here, we designed sub-micron monolithic full-color R/G/B nanorod LEDs with an Al core-shell reflector on single chip. The optimal structures for light confinement and vertical light extraction by single InGaN nanorod R/G/B LED structures were identified. The single nanorod with Al core-shell structure dramatically increased the light extraction efficiency, and showed an improvement of more than 20%, especially in the red wavelength. As a result, by introducing a long-length nanorod structure, we have successfully designed a new submicron pixel with full-color R/G/B LEDs operating within 1 μm × 1 μm size. This unique design will be a key factor in enabling the next generation of AR and VR displays that require ultra-small and compact pixels.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3236014","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2021R1A2C1003999,2020M3F3A2A03082762,2022M3H4A3A01082883); Korea Institute of Ceramic Engineering & Technology(grant numbers:1415181794); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10014683","FDTD;InGaN;LED;light reflector;nanorod","Light emitting diodes;Nanostructures;Substrates;Reflectivity;Periodic structures;Optical reflection;Stimulated emission","","","","39","CCBY","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By adjusting the thickness of five ring-shaped cores, the fundamental mode (HE11) in the small side ring-shaped fiber cores couple to different higher order vector modes (TE01, HE21, TM01, HE31) in the large center ring-shaped fiber core, which makes the light field transfer from small side cores to large center core and realizes the multiplexing of 6 vortex modes (TE01, $\text{OAM}_{ \pm 1,1}^ \pm $, TM01, $\text{OAM}_{ \pm 2,1}^ \pm $). The transmission characteristics are analyzed with supermode theory. The $\Delta {n}_{\text{eff}}$ of adjacent vector modes is larger than ${10}^{ - 4}$ due to the thin center ring core.

While there is a kink in the output characteristics of HEMT1, there is no such kink in the output characteristics of HEMT2. The kink is attributed to impact ionization in the GaN channel. Surface and interface traps of HEMT1 increase the peak electric field at the drain side gate edge and cause impact ionization. The post-gate metallization annealing at a higher temperature reduces the surface and interface traps, which reduces the peak electric field in HEMT2 and suppresses impact ionization. This is substantiated by TCAD simulations. Threshold voltage instability on the application of negative gate bias stress was also examined for these devices. A positive shift in threshold voltage was observed in HEMT1 on the application of negative gate bias stress, whereas the corresponding shift was negative in HEMT2, indicating the presence of two different types of traps in HEMT1 and HEMT2.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2022.3224500","Centre for NEMS and Nanophotonics (CNNP), Indian Institute of Technology Madras; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963604","HEMT;impact ionization;floating source;negative gate bias stress;traps","Logic gates;Impact ionization;MODFETs;HEMTs;Temperature;Voltage measurement;Annealing","","","","35","CCBY","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article quantitatively describes the performance of a dual induction eddy current probe that selectively suppresses only the vibration signal from detection signals, comparing this with the frequency filtering method and the multi-frequency method. Simulation and measurement results show that the proposed probe suppresses vibration signals and does not suppress crack signals; however, the current methods suppress both signals.

We demonstrate how this method can be applied to the design of BMIs by comparing TUVA values computed for simulated lead-field maps for high-channel-count electrocorticography (ECoG) with values computed for recordings in the interictal period in the context of surgery planning for epileptic resection.Clinical Relevance— This paper introduces a new statistical method for comparison of neural interface designs, focused on quantifying recording efficiency by minimizing channel crosstalk, which may help improve the risk-benefit profile of invasive neural recording.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340518","","Statistical analysis;Surgery;Crosstalk;Lead;Brain-computer interfaces;Biology;Recording","Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electrocorticography;Epilepsy;Prostheses and Implants","","","7","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, there are no optimal solutions to investigate how auditory, visual and tactile signals are integrated during EEG recording in infants and children. The present work aims to introduce Dr-MUSIC, a novel multisensory device with EEG-compatible timing and an attractive design for children. It is composed of audio, visual, and tactile stimulators arranged in the form of a couple of chubby dragons that can simultaneously provide selectable uni-, bi-, or tri-modal information. We first validated the system’s EEG compatibility in 8 adults by implementing an audio-tactile oddball task during a high-density EEG recording. Then, we replicated the same task in a couple of toddlers to validate the device’s usability for young children. The results suggest that the system can be effectively used for setting new experimental protocols to understand the neural basis of multisensory integration in the first years of life.Clinical Relevance— The amusing design and the possibility of changing the stimulation’s characteristics (i.e., light, sound, and vibrotactile features) make it attractive in children with and without sensory impairments.

Firstly, the aperture size of the E (or H) plane is calculated with the help of the optimal gain principle. Secondly, the constraint equation of another plane is derived. Finally, the intersection of constraint equation and interpolation function, which can be solved iteratively, contains all the solution information. The general radiation patterns neglect the influence of the Huygens element factor which makes the error bigger in large design beamwidth. In this paper, through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, two correction formulas are employed to correct the Huygens element factor's influence on the E/H planes.

Although digital transformation has become significant for the sustainability of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), they are challenged by the barriers to digitalisation due to their limited resources, and the complexity of equivalent commercial solutions. Low-cost digital solutions are often tailored to meet the requirements of SMEs to initiate their digital transformation. However, there is a lack of studies about the cost-effectiveness of acquiring low-cost digital solutions compared to off-the-shelf commercial tools, particularly for SMEs. This study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of low-cost digital solutions for SMEs through a real-world case study performed in a sustainable building components manufacturer and off-site construction SME. We developed a low-cost inventory tracking solution using a so-called `Digital Shoestring' approach, which provides a template for designing digital solutions based on low-cost readily available hardware and software components. The time/effort and cost spent on designing and developing the digital solution were compared with potential off-the-shelf commercial inventory tracking solutions. The results showed that the low-cost inventory tracking solution facilitated the digital transformation of the construction SME in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the inventory tracking solution was tailored based on the user requirements of the SME, thereby making it more suitable for their day-to-day operations.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324516","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Manual segmentation is still practiced, but it is time-consuming and highly dependent on the expertise of clinicians or image analysts. Prior studies have developed various skull-stripping algorithms that perform well on brains with mild or no structural abnormalities. Nonetheless, they were not able to address the issue for brains with significant morphological changes, such as those caused by brain tumors, particularly when the tumors are located near the skull’s border. In such cases, a portion of the normal brain may be stripped, or the reverse may occur during skull stripping. To address this limitation, we propose to use a novel deep learning framework based on nnUNet for skull stripping in brain MRI. Two publicly available datasets were used to evaluate the proposed method, including a normal brain MRI dataset - The Neurofeedback Skull-stripped Repository (NFBS), and a brain tumor MRI dataset - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The method proposed in the study performed better than six other current methods, namely BSE, ROBEX, UNet, SC-UNet, MV-UNet, and 3D U-Net. The proposed method achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.9960, a sensitivity of 0.9999, and a specificity of 0.9996 on the NFBS dataset, and an average Dice coefficient of 0.9296, a sensitivity of 0.9288, a specificity of 0.9866 and an accuracy of 0.9762 on the TCGA brain tumor dataset.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340846","","Deep learning;Image segmentation;Brain;Sensitivity;Three-dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Artificial neural networks","Humans;Deep Learning;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Skull;Brain;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain Neoplasms","","","19","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The diagnosis of OSA requires polysomnography (PSG) testing, which is unsuitable for large-scale preliminary screening due to its high cost and discomfort to wear. Therefore, a simple and inexpensive screening method would be of great value. This study presents a novel at-home OSA screening method using a smartwatch and a smartphone to obtain several physiological signals, snoring segments, and questionnaire information during a whole night's sleep. The proposed method can distinguish four OSA risk levels based on machine learning (ML) classifications; the system was validated by conducting an in-hospital study on 350 subjects with sleep disorders. The estimated OSA risk levels are in good agreement with the OSA severity diagnosed by PSG (correlation with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) = 0.92), and an encouraging classification performance is achieved (accuracy = 88.1%, 84.5%, 85.1%, sensitivity = 89.1%, 84.2%, 85.6% for mild, moderate and severe OSA).

Personalized thresholds of 50% and 80% of the maximum coupling values were used to identify generating electrode channels. In all patients, outflow coupling between α (8-15 Hz) and β (16-31 Hz) frequencies identified at least one electrode inside the resected seizure onset zone.

Early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in reducing the mortality rate from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). In recent years, bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has attracted great attention for the detection and diagnosis of csPCa. bpMRI is able to overcome some limitations of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) such as the use of contrast agents, the time-consuming for imaging and the costs, and achieve detection performance comparable to mpMRI. However, inter-reader agreements are currently low for prostate MRI. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the development of deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided detection and diagnosis system (CAD). However, most of the existing DL models developed for csPCa identification are restricted by the scale of data and the scarcity in labels. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised pre-training scheme named SSPT-bpMRI with an image restoration pretext task integrating four different image transformations to improve the performance of DL algorithms. Specially, we explored the potential value of the self-supervised pre-training in fully supervised and weakly supervised situations.

This paper will focus on the provision of low-cost alternatives that may be applied by SMEs using the Shoestring Approach and explore the potential impacts that the use of low-cost technologies may have on their maintenance support activities, and provide a blueprint for transitioning, taking them from no maintenance to predictive maintenance, using low-cost sensors and SoC computers.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324490","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"
"Classification Model for Differentiating Post-ACLR Individuals Using Loading Rate Variation","N. A. Davidson; Y. K. Halkiadakis; K. D. Morgan",NA; NA; NA,2023 45th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),"11 Dec 2023","2023","","","1","4","In post-ACLR individuals, gait variability often represents the presence of altered motor control. Quantifying variable limb loading is challenging, yet nonlinear analyses have been successful in detecting changes in gait variability due to altered motor control. Here, nonlinear metrics were derived and used to train multiple machine learning models to classify between healthy controls and post-ACLR individuals. The metrics were extracted from individuals’ vertical ground reaction force data during a fast-walking trial as variable limb loading is exacerbated when the system is stressed and being challenged. It was hypothesized that effective differentiation between healthy control and post-ACLR individuals would be achieved using machine learning models derived from limb loading rate variability measures. Seventeen healthy control and fourteen post-ACLR participants with measured between-limb loading rate asymmetries completed the walking protocol. Ground reaction force data was collected on an instrumented treadmill where they performed walking trials at 1.5 m/s. Nonlinear limb loading rate measures extracted from the healthy controls and post-ACLR participants’ data served as inputs to the models in order to train them to distinguish between the two states. A Decision Tree Classifier that utilized a bagging strategy was the best model for distinguishing between healthy control and post-ACLR participants. The model was successful in classifying participants, reporting an accuracy score of 73%, precision score of 100%, and an AUC score of 0.77, despite the smaller dataset. The ability to detect and classify post-ACLR loading rate variation has significant clinical implications, as these methods could be implemented in clinical settings to diagnose pathological limb loading dynamics and/or altered motor control.Clinical Relevance— This classification model can be easily integrated into the clinic to help diagnose pathological limb loading based solely on vertical ground reaction forces and can aid clinicians in providing data-driven metrics to help inform rehabilitation decisions.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340530","","Legged locomotion;Motor drives;Pathology;Atmospheric measurements;Loading;Force;Machine learning","Humans;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries;Biomechanical Phenomena;Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction;Gait;Walking","","","19","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three datasets corresponding to gray matter, white matter, and the combination of gray and white matter tissues were used to train the models. These datasets were built from the comparison of histological images taken from SCI experiments in non-human primates and corresponding subject-specific finite element (FE) models. Four ML algorithms were evaluated and compared using cross-validation and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). After hyperparameter tuning, the AUC mean values for the algorithms ranged between 0.79 and 0.82, with a standard deviation no greater than 0.02. The findings of this study also showed that k-nearest neighbors and logistic regression algorithms were better at identifying injured elements than support vector machines and decision trees. Additionally, depending on the evaluated dataset, the mean values of other performance metrics, such as precision and recall, varied between algorithms. These initial results suggest that different algorithms might be more sensitive to the skewed distribution of classes in the studied datasets, and that identifying damage independently or simultaneously in the gray and white matter tissues might require a better definition of relevant features and the use of different ML algorithms. These approaches will contribute to improving the current understanding of the relationship between mechanical loading and tissue damage during SCI and will have implications for the development of prevention strategies for this condition.Clinical Relevance— Linking FE model predictions of mechanical loading to tissue damage is an essential step for FE models to provide clinically relevant information. Combined with imaging technologies, these models can provide useful insights to predict the extent of damage in animal subjects and guide the decision-making process during treatment planning.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340243","","Tissue damage;Computational modeling;Loading;Machine learning;Predictive models;Iron;Finite element analysis","Animals;Humans;Machine Learning;Spinal Cord Injuries;Algorithms;White Matter;Computer Simulation","","","15","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained glass slides have been used for cancer diagnosis and tumor detection. However, recently a variety of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides can be requested by pathologists to examine and confirm diagnoses for determining the subtype of a tumor when this is difficult using H&E slides only. Deep learning (DL) has received a lot of interest recently for image search engines to extract features from tissue regions, which may or may not be the target region for diagnosis. This approach generally fails to capture high-level patterns corresponding to the malignant or abnormal content of histopathology images. In this work, we are proposing a targeted image search approach, inspired by the pathologists’ workflow, which may use information from multiple IHC biomarker images when available. These IHC images could be aligned, filtered, and merged together to generate a composite biomarker image (CBI) that could eventually be used to generate an attention map to guide the search engine for localized search. In our experiments, we observed that an IHC-guided image search engine can retrieve relevant data more accurately than a conventional (i.e., H&E-only) search engine without IHC guidance. Moreover, such engines are also able to accurately conclude the subtypes through majority votes.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340099","Image Retrieval;Image Search;Histopathology;Immunohistochemistry;Biomarkers;Digital Pathology;Fuzzy Inference","Histopathology;Search engines;Feature extraction;Reliability;Cancer;Tumors;Immune system","Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Neoplasms;Biomarkers, Tumor","","","24","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Often the voiding flow impacts the toilet wall (often made of ceramic) instead of the water. This causes a reduction in the amplitude of the recorded audio signal, and thus a reduction in the amplitude of the extracted envelope. Analysing the envelope alone, it is not possible to tell accurately if the reduction in the amplitude is due to a low voiding flow or an impact on the toilet walls. In this work, we carry out a study on the classification of sound uroflowmetry data depending on the medium where the urine impacts within the toilet: water or ceramic. In the analysis, a classification algorithm is proposed to identify the physical medium automatically based on the urination acoustics. The classification algorithm takes as input the frequency spectrum, the variance, and the kurtosis of the audio signal corresponding to a voiding event.Clinical relevance— Sound uroflowmetry has a strong correlation with the standard uroflowmetry. It is useful for the non-invasive detection of pathologies associated with the urinary tract as a support tool for information processing and screening. It consists of a characterization of the urinary flow patterns by capturing the sound generated when the urine stream impacts the water in the toilet. Identifying the medium which originates the sound is of paramount importance to better interpret the sound uroflowmetry.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340174","","Pathology;Correlation;Measurement uncertainty;Acoustics;Classification algorithms;Ceramics;Object recognition","Urodynamics;Urination;Sound;Acoustics;Water","","","16","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Estimating human arm stiffness during overground interactive tasks is a promising first step toward this goal. For this, an arm stiffness estimation technique was developed in our previous works that consider the unique challenges involving overground pHRI, such as the need to estimate the arm stiffness from a short duration of data with fewer repetitions. In this work, our stiffness estimation method is further validated with a passive spring setup with known stiffness values, as well as with a human experiment setup that resembles the widely used seated reaching tasks. Results show that our method can estimate the passive spring stiffness within 0.5% of error. We also show that the human arm stiffness measured through our method is comparable to those reported in well-known literature. In addition, our method was able to discern experimental conditions such as early vs. late trials or differences in arm movement conditions.

One challenge in controlling the hybrid knees is accurate gait mode prediction for seamless transitions between passive and active modes. However, data imbalance between passive and active modes may impact the performance of a classifier. In this study, we used a dataset collected from nine individuals with a unilateral transfemoral amputation as they ambulated over level ground, inclines, and stairs. We evaluated several machine learning-based classifiers on the prediction of passive (level-ground walking, incline walking, descending stairs, and donning and doffing the prosthesis) and active mode (ascending stairs). In addition, we developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create synthetic data for improving classification performance. The results indicated that linear discriminant analysis and random forest might be the best classifiers regarding sensitivity to the active mode and overall accuracy, respectively.

It can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life and can result in decreased physical activity and social isolation. The presented closure mechanism for a mechatronic intraurethral artificial urinary sphincter is designed to be inserted minimally invasive into the urethra. The device consists of a solid shell, which serves as a housing for the electronics and is designed to enable fixation in the urethra. During micturition, the urine flows through the system, where it is guided through an elastic silicone-tube that, on the one hand, enables closure by a squeezing mechanism and, on the other hand, prevents biofilm growth by oscillation at a frequency of 22.5 Hz. The squeezing mechanism consists of a pinch valve system actuated by a piezo motor. The system has been tested under urodynamic conditions and the results show that it is able to close the urethra effectively to restore continence. The device is able to withstand sudden loads and shows good performance in terms of biofilm prevention during first experiments with artificial urine.

To enhance the capability of the environmental adaptation, phase stabilization and vibration absorption are taken at the optical transmitting end. The temperature-dependent fiber propagation delay is stabilized to suppress the long-term drift. For the mechanical vibration, phase stabilization seems to have no obvious improvement on the fiber link, while vibration absorption can significantly suppress the high vibration frequency at the transmitting end.

"Measurement of the Three-Dimensional Muscle Endpoint Forces in the Extended Thumb and Its Application to Determining Muscle Combinations that Enable Lateral Pinch Force Production Throughout the Plane of Flexion-Extension","J.

That is, pinch force magnitudes have varied by 10-fold and have been reported to be as low as low as tenths of a pound. We believe a novel tendon transfer approach in which the donor muscle actuates a small group of paralyzed thumb muscles, instead of just the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) muscle (the current approach), will enable endpoint forces that are better directed and therefore a consistently stronger pinch force following surgery. We further believe that such surgeries can be better designed to account for grasp force production throughout the entire plane of flexion-extension if muscle endpoint forces in the extended thumb are known. Consequently, we measured muscle endpoint forces in the extended thumb in 6 cadaveric specimens after a force of 10 N was applied to each muscle. Further, we simulated a tendon transfer surgery in which the donor muscle applied equal force to each muscle in 246 small groups of muscles, calculated the direction of the resulting endpoint force throughout the flexion-extension plane, and determined if those groups of muscles produced a better directed force than FPL’s. While we found that 3 individual muscles and 52 muscle groups could produce desirably directed endpoint forces in parts of the flexion-extension plane, no muscle or muscle group could produce well-directed endpoint forces throughout the flexion-extension plane. We concluded that a group of muscles could likely be found if the donor muscle provided different levels of force to each of the muscles in a muscle group. This would be possible through intentional geometric manipulation of the donor-to-recipient muscle attachment to allow for unequal splitting of donor muscle force.Clinical Relevance—This work aims to determine whether the same combination of thumb muscles can produce well-directed endpoint forces throughout the flexion-extension plane. If so, then this work informs surgeons which muscle groups could be involved in a tendon transfer to restore lateral pinch grasp ability throughout the plane of flexion-extension in person with cervical spinal cord injury.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340817","","Force measurement;Force;Thumb;Surgery;Production;Muscles;Biology","Humans;Thumb;Muscle, Skeletal;Tendon Transfer;Spinal Cord Injuries;Hand Strength","","","13","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most coherence estimators are obtained from a Hermitian product based on local statistics. Increasing the number of samples in the local window can improve the estimation bias, but cause the loss of the estimated images spatial resolution. The limitations of these estimators lead to unclear contour of the disturbed region, and even the omission of fine change targets. In this paper, a CCD approach is proposed to detect fine scene changes from multi-temporal and multi-angle SAR image pairs. Multi-angle CCD estimator can improve the contrast between the change target and the background clutter by jointly accumulating single-angle alternative estimator results without further loss of image resolution. The sensitivity of detection performance to image quantity and angle interval is analyzed.

In these machines, the armature winding experiences rotating fields that generate AC losses, making it essential to estimate these losses during machine design. While analytical and finite element analysis (FEA) models are available in the literature for estimating AC losses, these models for multi-filament MgB2 superconductors have yet to be experimentally validated for machine operating regions. This article presents a high-precision AC-loss test setup to measure AC losses in SC MgB2 windings under rotating fields at the air-gap field, frequency, and operating temperature levels relevant to electrical machine applications. The experimentally measured AC losses are then compared with analytical and FEA models. Results demonstrate good agreement between measurements and predictions. The paper discusses the experimental setup, sample preparation, calibration, measurement method, and results.

While the underlying mechanisms between obesity and cancer are still unknown, obesity disrupts the role of adipocytes in energy homeostasis, and the alteration of adipokine, insulin and sex steroid signaling. Recently, it has been identified that adipose tissue-derived exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) regulate metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we collected ELVs from adipose tissue of an obese mouse (ob/ob) strain and control mouse (C57BL/6) strain, and checked whether adipose ELVs influence radiation-induced cell death on mouse fibroblast cells (m5S). Furthermore, we analyzed the micronucleus (MN) frequency in survived cells after radiation exposure to investigate the effect of ELVs on radiation-induced genomic instability. We first observed that ELVs from control and obese mice showed enhanced colony forming ability in un-irradiated m5S cells. However, enhanced survival was observed only in 3 Gy-irradiated m5S cells with obese ELV treatment. Despite no ELV effect on colony size, interestingly, the frequency of MN in survived m5S cells after 3 Gy irradiation was elevated when treated obese ELVs compared to control ELVs. These results suggested that obese mouse adipose ELVs could enhance the survival of irradiated cells harboring increased radiation-induced genomic instability.","1349-9157","","10.1093/jrr/rrac102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091855","radiation-induced genomic instability;extracellular vesicles;adipose tissue;animal model","","","","","","","3 Apr 2023","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, due to the individual variability, it is still challenging for an EOG-based eye movement recognition model to achieve favorable results among cross-subjects.

In this paper, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the log-Power Spectral Density (log-PSD) features of horizontal EOG (HEOG) between the target subject and each source subject is calculated for adaptively selecting partial subjects that suppose to have similar distribution with target subject for further training. It not only consider the similarity but also reduce computational consumption. The results show that the proposed approach is superior to the baseline and classical transfer learning methods, and significantly improves the performance of target subjects who have poor performance with the primary classifiers.

In this paper, to improve the fairness of PCON, we introduce our proposed AQM enhancement for PCON and newly propose a suppression method to excessive window reduction caused by simultaneous congestions on multiple paths. Furthermore, we propose a flow-aware traffic steering technique for balancing congestion inspired by a MPTCP's design policy. The combination of these techniques dramatically improves fairness among consumers and quickly brings us achieving closer to the complete resource pooling state.

However, the traditional OPO bulk material using high voltage electric field poling limits the flexibility of the poling period. In this paper, we propose a novel OPO design based on all-optical poled silicon nitride, allowing for adjustable poling period. Two OPO design schemes are presented, each offering unique advantages in terms of operational characteristics and performance. The output characteristics of the OPO are investigated in three modes: OPO pump tuning, poling fundamental wave (PFW) tuning, and OPO pump tuning and PFW tuning with the same laser. For OPO pump tuning, the OPO achieves output wavelengths of 3.319- $5.265 ~\mu \text{m}$  and 2.225- $3.769 ~\mu \text{m}$  with PFW wavelengths of 1450 nm and 1700 nm. For PFW tuning, the OPO produces output wavelengths of 5.502- $3.722 ~\mu \text{m}$  and 5.497- $3.577 ~\mu \text{m}$  using OPO pump wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1654 nm, respectively. Furthermore, for OPO pump tuning and PFW tuning with the same laser, the OPO generates output wavelengths ranging from  $5.504 ~\mu \text{m}$  to  $3.941 ~\mu \text{m}$  with OPO pump and PFW wavelengths ranging from  $1.420 ~\mu \text{m}$  to  $1.610 ~\mu \text{m}$ .

Vessel cores were coated in silicone, surrounded in tissue-mimicking gel tailored for ultrasound and needle insertion, and dissolved with water. One upper arm and four inguinal phantoms were constructed. Operators used AI-GUIDE to deploy needles into phantom vessels. Two groin phantoms were tested due to imaging artifacts in the other two phantoms. Six operators (medical experience: none, 3; 1-5 years, 2; 5+ years, 1) inserted 27 inguinal needles with 81% (22/27) success in a median of 48 seconds. Seven operators performed 24 arm injections, without tuning the AI for arm anatomy, with 71% (17/24) success. After excluding failures due to motor malfunction and a defective needle, success rate was 100% (22/22) in the groin and 85% (17/20) in the arm.

In traditional optical imaging system, the lenslet array or the reference beam and special algorithms are usually needed to solve this problem, which increase the complexity of the system. As a computational optical imaging technology, the problem of single-pixel imaging (SPI) for an occluded object has not been researched yet as we know. Here we propose an SPI system to recover the occluded object image. Firstly, the images of object and occlusion from different perspectives are obtained by detecting the light field at different positions. Secondly, the limited conditions of the system parameters are derived by using geometric optics theory to ensure complete imaging. Thirdly, the feasibility of the scheme and the correctness of the limited conditions are verified by experiments. The results in this article can promote the application of SPI technology in many complex practices.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3281820","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62205127); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10141646","Image reconstruction techniques;occluded object imaging;single-pixel imaging","Imaging;Probes;Optical imaging;Image segmentation;Lenses;Diffraction;Optical fiber sensors","","","","24","CCBYNCND","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it can withstand an unlimited range of transmission delay variations without using any optical or electrical delay lines. Experimentally, binary phase-shift keying signals with bandwidths of several hundred MHz and different carrier frequencies are transmitted and received by the proposed system.

Arctangent demodulation is an effective means of quantifying continuous displacement using a quadrature Doppler radar, yet it depends on accurate identification of dc offset and dc information contributions in the radar I-Q arc with the subject in a particular position.

To further improve its torque density, this paper proposes a control method by using harmonic current strategy. Based on the theoretical analysis, a 3-D torque look-up table by $dq$-axis current and electrical angle is established with the aid of the finite element method (FEM). The maximum torque per ampere curve at each rotor position is identified and summarized to adequately indicate the relationship between torque and current amplitude of the motor. Through theoretical derivation, it is concluded that the minimum torque cost curve is the contour line of $\partial T_{\pmb{e}}/\partial i^{2}$, which can be employed to identify the harmonic current for torque density improvement. Compared to traditional strategies, the proposed control strategy can increase torque density of forward and reverse torque by 1.22% and 1.40%, respectively.

And we may need to find blackbox videos recorded by the third party to accurately analyze the cause of the accident. One of the basic requirements of blackbox data is integrity, and this integrity can be provided by uploading the data to blockchains. However, the existing blackbox data storage systems have two big problems, cost and privacy. The transaction fees are the costs necessary to upload data to the blockchains. The transaction fees of the major public blockchain are getting higher. Therefore, if a user uses Bitcoin or Ethereum to upload its blackbox video, the costs could be very expensive. On the other hand, the private information such as driving route could be revealed from the uploaded information to the blockchain. We suggest a cost-effective searchable blackbox data storage system with strong anonymity, i.e. unlinkability, using blockchains. In our scheme, the cost of registering a blackbox video is  $\frac {cost_{tr}}{n}$ , where  $cost_{tr}$  is the cost necessary to upload a transaction to a blockchain and  $n$  is the number of uploading users at the same time. Therefore, our scheme is practical with public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The consumption of these video services is expected to continue to increase. Video traffic, which accounted for 64% of Internet traffic in 2014, is expected to account for more than 81% of Internet traffic by 2022, and 86% of corporate marketers use video content in online campaigns. Users can immediately check which channel it is through the thumbnail of the video, and the click-through rate of the video changes. Therefore, thumbnails can represent images and play a role in stimulating curiosity. In this situation, this study analysed the relationship between users' attitudes and satisfaction according to the visual expression elements of video streaming service thumbnails on the web. For this purpose, a survey was conducted, with subjects in their 20s. As a result of the study, looking at the effect of visual expression elements of video thumbnails on viewing attitudes, it was found that images and typography had a significant positive (+) effect on the order of images and typography. Also, as a result of analysing the relationship between viewing attitudes and viewing satisfaction, it was found that viewing attitudes toward video had a significant positive (+) effect on viewing satisfaction. Lastly, looking at the effect of visual expression elements of YouTube thumbnails on viewer satisfaction, it was found that images and colours had a significant positive effect on the order of images and colour.

When azimuthal coupling must be taken into account, the splitting method may be used to efficiently solve a 3-D parabolic equation that handles the depth operator to higher order but handles the azimuth operator only to leading order. Despite the fact that this approximation provides a favorable combination of accuracy and efficiency for 3-D problems, run times have generally been regarded as prohibitive for the long-range problems that are often of interest in ocean acoustics. It is demonstrated here that, when propagation paths from source to receiver are confined to a relatively narrow neighborhood of the vertical plane containing the source and receiver, it is practical to solve 3-D problems out to long ranges by using nonuniform azimuthal sampling, with fine sampling near the vertical plane and extremely coarse sampling elsewhere.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287217","Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155118","Ocean acoustics;range dependence;azimuthal coupling;3-D effects;parabolic equation method;splitting method;nonuniform grids","Mathematical models;Oceans;Acoustics;Azimuth;Couplings;Receivers;Sediments","","","","18","CCBYNCND","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the contrary, fast MR thermometry techniques can provide a reliable real-time map of temperature rise in the tissue in the vicinity of conductive implants. In this proof-of-concept study, we examined whether a machine learning (ML) based model could predict the temperature increase in the tissue near the tip of an implanted lead after several minutes of RF exposure based on only a few seconds of experimentally measured temperature values. We performed phantom experiments with a commercial deep brain stimulation (DBS) system to train a fully connected feedforward neural network (NN) to predict temperature rise after ~3 minutes of scanning at a 3 T scanner using only data from the first 5 seconds. The NN effectively predicted ΔTmax—R2 = 0.99 for predictions in the test dataset.

These variations can lead to a decrease in the overall yield of the field-effect transistor (FET). This study shows how a low-frequency signal may regulate the number of CNTs on electrodes with a nanometer scale. We also demonstrate using an interdigitated electrode to reduce the shorts caused by metallic CNTs. The fabricated CNFETs were characterized using SEM, AFM, and I-V measurements.

It is essential in accomplishing everyday activities and strongly correlates with sleep processes. However, despite valuable knowledge of the spatial mechanisms in the visual modality, the multi-sensory aspects of SM have yet to be thoroughly investigated due to a lack of proper technologies.This work presents a novel acoustic system built around 3D audio spatial technology. Our goal was to examine if an afternoon nap can improve memory performance, measured through the acoustic version of the Corsi Block Tapping Task (CBTT), named Audio-Corsi. We tested five adults over two days. During one of the two days (Wake), participants performed the Audio-Corsi before (Pre) and after (Post) a wake resting period; while the other day (Sleep), participants performed the Audio-Corsi before (Pre) and after (Post) a nap. Day orders were randomized. We calculated the memory span for the Pre and Post session in both the Wake and Sleep days. Preliminary results show a significant difference in the memory span between the Wake and Sleep days. Specifically, memory span decreased between the pre-and post-test during the wake day. The opposite trend was found for the sleep day. Results indicate that SM can be improved by sleeping also in the acoustic modality other than the visual one.Clinical Relevance— The technology and procedure we designed and developed could be suitable in clinical and experimental settings to study high-level cognitive skills in the auditory sensory modality and their relationship with sleep, especially when vision is absent or distorted (i.e. blindness).","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10339960","European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10339960","","Training;Visualization;Atmospheric measurements;Blindness;Particle measurements;Market research;Acoustic measurements","Adult;Humans;Spatial Memory;Sleep;Cognition;Blindness","","","26","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both vibration-based and ultrasound/acoustic emission (AE) based sensing techniques have been proposed in the literature to detect faults in rolling element bearings running at low speeds. The vibration-based technique generally works within the frequency band from 0 to 20 kHz. Meanwhile, the ultrasound/AE-based techniques work in a very high-frequency band, from 20 kHz up to 1 MHz. Consequently, processing ultrasound/AE sensor data requires more computational resources compared to processing vibration data. Moreover, the hardware investment to build an ultrasound/AE-based CM system is more expensive than that of a vibration-based CM system. Since hardware and software cost is one of the main bottlenecks of the adoption of CM systems in the industry, it is, therefore, necessary to develop a cost-effective vibration-based CM system for critical bearings mounted on low-rotational speed machines. The paper presents a feasibility study in evaluating the performance of an off-the-shelf low-cost vibration sensor (10-20 times cheaper than high-end vibration sensors) with a low frequency resonance (around 75 Hz) to diagnose faults on REBs operating at a low rotational speed of 30 - 60 rpm. The low-resonance frequency characteristic of the low-cost sensor allows us to acquire the data at a low sampling rate of 400 Hz. A theoretical justification of why a vibration sensor with low-resonance frequency can still be effective for low-speed bearing fault diagnosis is given. This feasibility was experimentally validated on a test rig on which an REB with a seeded fault on the outer race was tested as a case study. A high-end vibration sensor (accelerometer) acquired at a 20 kHz sampling rate was also used as a benchmark. The vibration signals measured by the low-cost and high-end sensors in four different operating conditions were analysed with the well-established envelope analysis. In addition, the high-end sensor signals were also analysed with the state-of-the-art Spectral Correlation (SC) technique to compute the Enhanced Envelope Spectrum (EES) for bearing fault detection and diagnosis. The results confirmed that the bearing fault could be successfully detected and diagnosed in all the test conditions by the low-cost sensor analysed with the envelope analysis technique. On the other hand, the high-end sensor analysed with the SC technique could only diagnose the bearing fault for the least challenging test condition. The outstanding diagnostic capability of the low-cost sensor sampled at a low sampling rate has set a milestone that would enable the future development of a low-cost CM system for low-speed bearing applications.","","978-1-83953-932-9","10.1049/icp.2023.1748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324683","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Electrostatic energy is a pollution-free environmental energy source. The use of electrostatic conversion devices to convert electrostatic energy into electrical energy has been proven to be a feasible solution to meet sustainable development. This paper proposes a light-controlled electrostatic conversion device (LCECD). When static electricity comes, an avalanche breakdown occurs inside the LCECD and a low resistance path is generated to clamp the voltage, thereby outputting a smooth square wave of voltage and current. Experiments have proved that LCECD can convert 30kV electrostatic pulses into usable electrical energy for the normal operation of the back-end light-emitting diode lights. In addition, the LCECD will change the parasitic capacitance after being exposed to light. For different wavelengths of light, the parasitic capacitance exhibited by the device will also be different. The smaller the parasitic capacitance of the LCECD, the higher the efficiency of its electrostatic conversion. This is of great significance to the design of electrostatic conversion devices in the future.","2075-5597","","10.23919/cje.2021.00.272","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61827812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038830","Environmental energy;Electrostatic energy;Electrostatic conversion;Parasitic capacitance","Resistance;Breakdown voltage;Wavelength measurement;Electrostatic measurements;Capacitors;Lighting;Clamps","","","","15","","7 Feb 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

The aim of this study is to investigate age-related changes in knee AE and determine AE hit definition modes as well as AE hit parameters that allow for improved age group differentiation. Knee AEs were recorded from 51 participants in two age groups (18-35 and 50-75 years old) whilst cycling with 30 and 60 rpm cadence. Two AE sensors with 15-40 kHz and 100-450 kHz frequency ranges were used, and three AE event detection modes investigated. Additionally, participants’ Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS) were recorded. Low frequency sensors (15-40kHz) and hit modes with shortened hit and peak definition times showed the potential to distinguish between age groups. Moreover, a weak correlation was found between only three parameters (AE event median duration, rise time, and signal strength) and age, indicating that changes in joint AE are most likely associated with pathological changes rather than physiological ageing within the healthy norm.Clinical Relevance— the use of AE monitoring was examined in the context of age-related changes in knee health.

A novel monitoring approach is based on the mechanical properties of the battery, which change during the charge/discharge process and during its lifetime. In this approach, an acoustic wave is generated inside the battery by a transmitter and propagates through the layered structure of the cell to a receiver. The propagation speed of the wave changes depending on the mechanical properties of the cell, and so does the measurable time of flight between the transmitter and receiver. To apply this monitoring approach, it is essential to understand how this wave actually forms and travels through the individual layers. To improve this understanding, a model is presented that simulates both the generation and propagation of the wave within the battery. The model is parametrized by performing reference measurements and a tear down analysis of the battery. The simulation result shows good agreement with the measurement results and also provides a visualization of the acoustic wave motion within the cell, which greatly improves the understanding of the propagating wave.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2023.3300805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198561","Sensor applications;battery modeling;electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT);Lamb mode propagation;lithium-ion pouch cell;nondestructive testing;sensor modeling","Batteries;Battery charge measurement;Acoustic measurements;Accelerometers;Current measurement;Monitoring;Anodes","","","","20","CCBY","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, increasing the number of transducers to benefit from the entire catheter surface is challenging due to the number of connections and/or the required integrated circuits dedicated for multiplexing the transducer signals. Modular concepts enabling personalized catheters are lacking, at all. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of a simple and daisy-chainable transducer node network for active catheters, which overcomes these limitations. Sequentially accessible nodes enabling analog interaction (including signal buffering) with transducers were designed and fabricated using miniature components suited for catheter integration. The effective sampling rate (ESR) per node for acquiring bio-signals from 10 nodes was examined for various signal-to-noise ratios. Thanks to the low circuit complexity, an ESR up to 20 kHz was achieved, which is high enough for many bio-signals.Clinical relevance— Typical daisy-chaining features, namely theoretically indefinite node extension and simple reconfiguration facilitates modularization of the catheter design.

The nanosecond CDR can be achieved by utilizing a global frequency-synchronized reference clock for both transmitters (TX) and receivers (RX) and adopting a phase compensation scheme, which leads to predictably managed frequency and phase. However, the CDR still needs to be comprehensively evaluated considering various interferes. We add more analysis by developing a novel optoelectronic co-simulation system that combines the software Opti-system and MATLAB/Simulink. We set up a simple OPS network equipped with the CDR architecture using the simulation system. The feasibility of the CDR mechanism is validated, then various interferes are characterized to evaluate the CDR's stability, including the location variation of reference clock source, channel jitters, and carrier power variations.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3307687","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA0717700); National NSF of China(grant numbers:62211530492,62141411,62004096,62004097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227535","Data center networks;optical packet switching network;clock and data recovery;MATLAB/Simulink;opti-system","Clocks;Optical packet switching;Mathematical models;Optical switches;Codes;Optical transmitters;Delays","","","","21","CCBY","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The advanced airway mode and 30:2 mode are used for intubated and non-intubated patients, respectively. It is debatable that passive produced by 30 compressions can provide adequate tidal volume for 30:2 mode. In addition, the fragmented ventilation caused by continuous compression may result in ineffective ventilation. In the study, one pig was anaesthetized and intubated for 2 CPRs. Continuous chest compressions with ventilation and continuous chest compressions without mechanical ventilation were performed in 2 CPRs, respectively. Three 10-minute data segments including a period of normal ventilation (V segment), a period of only compressions without ventilation (C segment), and a period of compressions with ventilation (C-V segment) were used to analyze peek flow (PF), peek pressure (PP) and tidal volume. All the data was presented as mean ± standard deviation. Chest compression resulted in 14.90% increase in mean PP (2401.40 ± 94.75 Pa vs 2822.06 ± 291.10 Pa, p<0.05), 81.46% increase in average PF (319.58 ± 56.93 ml/s vs 579.92 ± 80.27 ml/s, p<0.05). The mean tidal volumes for C segment, V segment and C-V segment were 189.13 ml, 514.72 ml, and 429.26ml, respectively. Continuous compressions reduced the accumulative tidal volume, but when five compressions were made in one inspiratory phase, there is almost no loss of tidal volume (510.86 ± 47.24 ml vs 514.72 ± 29.25 ml, p<0.05). The study suggested the ventilator without feedback regulation might reduce the peek pressure during CPR and 5 compressions in 2 s inspiratory phase provided higher tidal volume.Clinical Relevance— This study shows that 150 chest compressions per minute provided greater tidal volume than 100 and 120 compressions per minute; continuous chest compressions could also provide a certain amount of oxygen supply.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340259","Research and Development; Research and Development; Shandong University; Shandong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340259","","Ventilators;Animals;Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Manuals;Ventilation;Regulation;Biology","Humans;Animals;Swine;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Respiration, Artificial;Ventilators, Mechanical;Tidal Volume","","","21","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our algorithm uses singular value decomposition to outline the cortical area involved in this task. For proof of concept, we evaluate our algorithm using data from 10 subjects with epilepsy. Our algorithm has a statistically significant overlap with the somatosensory cortex (the expected active area in healthy subjects) in 6 of 10 subjects. Having thus demonstrated proof of concept, we conclude that our algorithm is ready for further testing in a larger cohort of subjects.Clinical relevance— Our algorithm identifies the dominant cortical area and boundary of the cortical tissue involved in a task-related response.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340978","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340978","","Somatosensory;Location awareness;Magnetoencephalography;Epilepsy;Recording;Neurosurgery;Task analysis","Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Somatosensory Cortex;Epilepsy;Neurosurgical Procedures;Algorithms","","","18","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The Sensitivity of the Endpoint Forces of Thumb Extrinsic and Intrinsic Muscles to Changes in Joint Angles, Muscle Moment Arms and Bone Lengths in the Flexed Thumb","J. D.

Potential sources of variability include inter-specimen anatomic differences and postural deviations from the nominal posture in which the specimens were tested. This study aimed to theoretically determine the variation in thumb-tip force caused by inter-specimen differences in thumb anatomy and posture. We developed a two-dimensional mathematical model of force production at the thumb tip based on published estimates of muscle moment arms, bone length, and joint angle measurements from nine cadaveric specimens. The model was placed in a flexed posture. Using the model, we calculated variations in magnitude and direction of each muscle’s thumb-tip force induced by a ±1 standard deviation (or equivalent) variation in each bone length, the moment arm of the muscle (i.e., anatomic factors), and each joint angle (i.e., postural factor). For most muscles, inter-specimen differences in the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint angle produced at least a 75% larger variation in thumb-tip force magnitude than that produced by other factors. For all muscles, differences in the interphalangeal joint angle among specimens produced the largest variation in thumb-tip force direction. For some muscles, inter-specimen differences in bone lengths, moment arms, and MP joint angles also produced large variations in thumb-tip force direction. This study suggests deviation from the nominal flexed thumb posture and large measurement variability in muscle moment arms are primary and secondary sources, respectively, of variability in thumb-tip forces produced by the majority of thumb muscles. Further, this study suggests a more careful approach to standardizing the thumb posture would likely improve current measurements of thumb-tip forces.Clinical Relevance— This work describes the influence of anatomic and postural factors on thumb-tip forces that thumb muscles produce. The results of this work have implications for musculoskeletal modeling and surgical reconstruction of grasp.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340552","","Force measurement;Current measurement;Force;Thumb;Surgery;Muscles;Arms","Humans;Thumb;Muscle, Skeletal;Metacarpophalangeal Joint;Mechanical Phenomena;Cadaver","","","9","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a cell tracking method to address these issues, which has two main contributions. First, we introduce cell position heatmap-based non-rigid alignment with test-time fine-tuning, which can warp the detected points to near the positions at the next frame. Second, we propose a pairwise detection method, which uses the information of detection results at the previous frame for detecting cells at the current frame.

Some of these devices provide raw bioimpedance data for research purposes. The SFB7 device from ImpediMed® is a typical portable clinical device which perform 256 measurement points from 3 kHz to 1 MHz, providing for each point the resistance R and the reactance X. Its main drawback is its impedance range, limited to only 1100 Ω, making it less suitable for more demanding, higher impedance, two-electrode measurements which are potentially of great clinical interest. Some benchtop reference devices have larger frequency and impedance ranges than the SFB7 but are not portable and are not designed specifically for BIS measurement on humans.This article proposes a method to overcome the impedance range limitation of the SFB7 by connecting in parallel to the investigated bioimpedance a fixed and known impedance, whose value (and hence that of the total measured impedance) is within the device’s range. The investigated impedance is then calculated by eliminating the contribution of the known impedance via a post processing of the data.This concept has been successfully tested on a physical model, and an in vivo example has validated the practicality of performing demanding two-electrode measurements on individuals using a SFB7, with relative errors of R and X inferior to 2.5% and 7% respectively.Clinical Relevance— Using the proposed setup and after post processing of the data, the SFB7 BIS device can now be used to perform demanding two-electrode measurements, hitherto impossible, enabling a range of novel clinical, high-impedance studies, for example for localized skin characterization.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340265","","Performance evaluation;Resistors;Spectroscopy;Impedance measurement;Biological system modeling;Measurement uncertainty;Bioimpedance","Humans;Electric Impedance;Electrodes;Spectrum Analysis","","","5","CCBY","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper documents the design process of a novel robotic hand, and shows experimental results validating its overall performance. A large focus was placed on developing a novel thumb mechanism which could replicate the thumb's characteristic movement types, namely flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and oppositionreposition. Additional focus was placed on developing a mechanism for flexion-extension movement of the fingers which did not incorporate passive components and on producing a fully self-contained prototype — with the electronics and actuators contained inside the palm, and the power supply inset against the back of the palm.

However, existing methods of vehicle angle prediction utilize only single-modal data to achieve model prediction, such as images captured by the camera, which limits the performance and efficiency of the prediction system. In this paper, we present Emma, a novel vehicle angle prediction strategy that achieves multi-modal prediction and is more efficient. Specifically, Emma exploits both images and inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals with a fusion network for multi-modal data fusion and vehicle angle prediction. Moreover, we design and implement a few-shot learning module in Emma for fast domain adaptation to varied scenarios (e.g., different vehicle models). Evaluation results demonstrate that Emma achieves overall 97.5% accuracy in predicting three vehicle angle parameters (yaw, pitch, and roll), which outperforms traditional single-modalities by approximately 16.7%–36.8%. Additionally, the few-shot learning module presents promising adaptive ability and shows overall 79.8% and 88.3% accuracy in 5-shot and 10-shot settings, respectively.

With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be directly applied to infrared small targets since pooling layers in their networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNA-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the repetitive interaction in DNIM, the information of infrared small targets in deep layers can be maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our DNA-Net, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and fully exploited by repetitive fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Specifically, the convolution module learns the low-level local features throughout the one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers. The self-attention module is straightforwardly connected to extract the global correlation within the local temporal features. Subsequently, the simple classifier module based on fully-connected layers is followed to predict the categories for EEG signals.

Therefore, there is a need for an oversampling method that is specifically tailored to deep learning models, can work on raw images while preserving their properties, and is capable of generating high-quality, artificial images that can enhance minority classes and balance the training set. We propose Deep synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), a novel oversampling algorithm for deep learning models that leverages the properties of the successful SMOTE algorithm. It is simple, yet effective in its design. It consists of three major components: 1) an encoder/decoder framework; 2) SMOTE-based oversampling; and 3) a dedicated loss function that is enhanced with a penalty term. An important advantage of DeepSMOTE over generative adversarial network (GAN)-based oversampling is that DeepSMOTE does not require a discriminator, and it generates high-quality artificial images that are both information-rich and suitable for visual inspection.

In DS-FL, the communication cost depends only on the output dimensions of the models and does not scale up according to the model size. The exchanged model outputs are used to label each sample of the open dataset, which creates an additionally labeled dataset. Based on the new dataset, local models are further trained, and model performance is enhanced owing to the data augmentation effect. We further highlight that in DS-FL, the heterogeneity of the devices’ dataset leads to ambiguous of each data sample and lowing of the training convergence. To prevent this, we propose entropy reduction averaging, where the aggregated model outputs are intentionally sharpened. Moreover, extensive experiments show that DS-FL reduces communication costs up to 99 percent relative to those of the FL benchmark while achieving similar or higher classification accuracy.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3070013","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP17H03266,JP18K13757); JST PRESTO(grant numbers:JPMJPR2035); KDDI Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392310","Federated learning;knowledge distillation;non-IID data;communication efficiency","Data models;Benchmark testing;Performance evaluation;Mobile handsets;Training;Computational modeling;Convergence","","125","","40","CCBY","31 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Exploring Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey","A.

To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224","Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program, Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105236","ChatGPT;students’ perceptions;education","Chatbots;Education;Codes;Encoding;Performance evaluation;Oral communication","","113","","38","CCBYNCND","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is still challenging to handle the imbalanced data when using conventional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based learning strategies. In this article, we propose a distribution bias aware collaborative GAN (DB-CGAN) model for imbalanced deep learning in industrial IoT, especially to solve limitations caused by distribution bias issue between the generated data and original data, via a more robust data augmentation. An integrated data augmentation framework is constructed by introducing a complementary classifier into the basic GAN model. Specifically, a conditional generator with random labels is designed and trained adversarially with the classifier to effectively enhance augmentation of the number of data samples in minority classes, while a weight sharing scheme is newly designed between two separated feature extractors, enabling the collaborative adversarial training among generator, discriminator, and classifier. An augmentation algorithm is then developed for intelligent anomaly detection in imbalanced learning, which can significantly improve the classification accuracy based on the correction of distribution bias using the rebalanced data. Compared with five baseline methods, experiment evaluations based on two real-world imbalanced datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed model in tackling the distribution bias issue for multiclass classification in imbalanced learning for industrial IoT applications.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3170149","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFE0190500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072171); Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province(grant numbers:2020SK2089); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017TP1026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763413","Collaborative adversarial training;data augmentation;distribution bias;generative adversarial network (GAN);imbalanced learning;industrial Internet of Things (IoT)","Training;Generators;Data models;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction;Industrial Internet of Things;Collaboration","","108","","27","CCBY","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These characteristics not only carve the Metaverse into a novel and fantastic digital world, but also make it suffer from all security/privacy risks, such as personal information leakage, eavesdropping, unauthorized access, phishing, data injection, broken authentication, insecure design, and more.

Despite its effectiveness in overcoming various challenges, cooperative perception's performance can still be affected by the aforementioned issues when Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operate at the edges of their sensing range. Our proposed approach called HYDRO-3D aims to improve object detection performance by explicitly incorporating historical object tracking information. Specifically, HYDRO-3D combines object detection features from a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm (V2X-ViT) with historical information from the object tracking algorithm to infer objects. Afterward, a novel spatial-temporal 3D neural network performing global and local manipulations of object-tracking historical data is applied to generate the feature map to enhance object detection. The proposed HYDRO-3D method is comprehensively evaluated on the state-of-the-art V2XSet. The qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate that the HYDRO-3D can effectively utilize the object tracking information and achieve robust object detection performance. It outperforms the SOTA V2X-ViT by 3.7% in AP@0.7 of object detection for CAVs and can also be generalized to single-vehicle object detection with 4.5% improvement in AP@0.7.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2023.3282567","RIMI: Infrastructure-assisted Automation; California Statewide Transportation Research Program; Federal Highway Administration Exploratory Advanced Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148929","Cooperative driving automation;cooperative perception;object detection and tracking;LiDAR","Object detection;Feature extraction;Object tracking;Point cloud compression;Trajectory;Laser radar;Tracking","","106","","71","CCBY","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To properly account for the new characteristics introduced by these three trends in communication system design, the near-field spherical-wave propagation model needs to be used, which differs from the classical far-field planar-wave one. As such, near-field communication (NFC) will become essential in 6G networks. In this tutorial, we cover three key aspects of NFC. 1) Channel Modelling: We commence by reviewing near-field spherical-wave-based channel models for spatially-discrete (SPD) antennas. Then, uniform spherical wave (USW) and non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) models are discussed. Subsequently, we introduce a general near-field channel model for SPD antennas and a Green’s function-based channel model for continuous-aperture (CAP) antennas. 2) Beamfocusing and Antenna Architectures: We highlight the properties of near-field beamfocusing and discuss NFC antenna architectures for both SPD and CAP antennas. Moreover, the basic principles of near-field beam training are introduced. 3) Performance Analysis: Finally, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis framework for NFC. For near-field line-of-sight channels, the received signal-to-noise ratio and power-scaling law are derived. For statistical near-field multipath channels, a general analytical framework is proposed, based on which analytical expressions for the outage probability, ergodic channel capacity, and ergodic mutual information are obtained. Finally, for each aspect, topics for future research are discussed.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2023.3305583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220205","Antenna architecture;beamforcusing;channel modelling;near-field communications;performance analysis","Antennas;Antenna arrays;6G mobile communication;Transmitting antennas;Channel models;Wireless networks;Tutorials","","102","","130","CCBY","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The characterization of the S&C performance tradeoff is at the core of the theoretical foundation of ISAC. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point (P2P) ISAC model under vector Gaussian channels, and propose to use the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)-rate region as a basic tool for depicting the fundamental S&C tradeoff. In particular, we consider the scenario where a unified ISAC waveform is emitted from a dual-functional ISAC transmitter (Tx), which simultaneously communicates information to a communication receiver (Rx) and senses targets with the help of a sensing Rx. In order to perform both S&C tasks, the ISAC waveform is required to be random to convey communication information, with realizations being perfectly known at both the ISAC Tx and the sensing Rx as a reference sensing signal as in typical radar systems. In this context, we treat the ISAC waveform as a random but known nuisance parameter in the sensing signal model, and define a Miller-Chang type CRB for the analysis of the sensing performance. As the main contribution of this paper, we characterize the S&C performance at the two corner points of the CRB-rate region, namely,  $P_{\mathrm{ SC}}$  indicating the maximum achievable communication rate constrained by the minimum CRB, and  $P_{\mathrm{ CS}}$  indicating the minimum achievable CRB constrained by the maximum communication rate. In particular, we derive the high-SNR communication capacity at  $P_{\mathrm{ SC}}$ , and provide lower and upper bounds for the sensing CRB at  $P_{\mathrm{ CS}}$ . We show that these two points can be achieved by the conventional Gaussian signalling and a novel strategy relying on the uniform distribution over the set of semi-unitary matrices, i.e., the Stiefel manifold, respectively. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we provide an outer bound and various inner bounds for the achievable CRB-rate regions. Our main results reveal a two-fold tradeoff in ISAC systems, consisting of the subspace tradeoff (ST) and the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) that depend on the resource allocation and data modulation schemes employed for S&C, respectively. Within this framework, we examine the state-of-the-art ISAC signalling strategies and study a number of illustrative examples, which are validated through numerical simulations.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2023.3284449","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101234); Guangdong Province “Pearl River” Young Talent Support Program(grant numbers:2021QN02X128); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:RCBS20210609103227018,20220815100308002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10147248","Integrated sensing and communication;Gaussian channels;CRB-rate region;deterministic-random tradeoff;subspace tradeoff","Sensors;Symbols;Receivers;Mathematical models;Task analysis;Covariance matrices;Wireless networks","","97","","55","CCBY","9 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conversely, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the F1 score are too specific—they are measured at a single threshold that is optimal for some instances, but not others, which is not equitable. In between both approaches, we propose deep ROC analysis to measure performance in multiple groups of predicted risk (like calibration), or groups of true positive rate or false positive rate. In each group, we measure the group AUC (properly), normalized group AUC, and averages of: sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio positive and negative. The measurements can be compared between groups, to whole measures, to point measures and between models.

In this work, we leverage the information of each training epoch to prune the prediction maps of the subsequent epochs. We propose a novel architecture called feedback attention network (FANet) that unifies the previous epoch mask with the feature map of the current training epoch. The previous epoch mask is then used to provide hard attention to the learned feature maps at different convolutional layers. The network also allows rectifying the predictions in an iterative fashion during the test time.

From a scientific point of view, there is no definite consensus on what the Metaverse will be like. This paper collects, analyzes, and synthesizes scientific definitions and the accompanying major characteristics of the Metaverse using the methodology of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Two revised definitions for the Metaverse are presented, both condensing the key attributes, where the first one is rather simplistic holistic describing “a three-dimensional online environment in which users represented by avatars interact with each other in virtual spaces decoupled from the real physical world”.

These applications are known for their real-time requirements under limited network and computing resources, thus it becomes a highly demanding task to transform and compute tremendous amount of raw data in a cloud center. The edge–cloud computing infrastructure allows a large amount of data to be processed on nearby edge nodes and then only the extracted and encrypted key features are transmitted to the data center. This offers the potential to achieve an end–edge–cloud-based big data intelligence for IoE in a typical two-stage data processing scheme, while satisfying a data security constraint. In this study, a deep-reinforcement-learning-enhanced two-stage scheduling (DRL-TSS) model is proposed to address the NP-hard problem in terms of operation complexity in end–edge–cloud Internet of Things systems, which is able to allocate computing resources within an edge-enabled infrastructure to ensure computing task to be completed with minimum cost. A presorting scheme based on Johnson’s rule is developed and applied to preprocess the two-stage tasks on multiple executors, and a DRL mechanism is developed to minimize the overall makespan based on a newly designed instant reward that takes into account the maximal utilization of each executor in edge-enabled two-stage scheduling. The performance of our method is evaluated and compared with three existing scheduling techniques, and experimental results demonstrate the ability of our proposed algorithm in achieving better learning efficiency and scheduling performance with a 1.1-approximation to the targeted optimal IoE applications.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3179231","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1705200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072171,72091515); Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2020SK2089); Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017TP1026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785600","Deep reinforcement learning;edge computing;Internet of Everything (IoE);makespan;two-stage scheduling","Task analysis;Internet of Things;Processor scheduling;Reinforcement learning;Scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Optimal scheduling","","82","","31","CCBY","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, only a few studies have comprehensively compared medical image registration approaches on a wide range of clinically relevant tasks. This limits the development of registration methods, the adoption of research advances into practice, and a fair benchmark across competing approaches. The Learn2Reg challenge addresses these limitations by providing a multi-task medical image registration data set for comprehensive characterisation of deformable registration algorithms. A continuous evaluation will be possible at https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org. Learn2Reg covers a wide range of anatomies (brain, abdomen, and thorax), modalities (ultrasound, CT, MR), availability of annotations, as well as intra- and inter-patient registration evaluation. We established an easily accessible framework for training and validation of 3D registration methods, which enabled the compilation of results of over 65 individual method submissions from more than 20 unique teams. We used a complementary set of metrics, including robustness, accuracy, plausibility, and runtime, enabling unique insight into the current state-of-the-art of medical image registration. This paper describes datasets, tasks, evaluation methods and results of the challenge, as well as results of further analysis of transferability to new datasets, the importance of label supervision, and resulting bias. While no single approach worked best across all tasks, many methodological aspects could be identified that push the performance of medical image registration to new state-of-the-art performance.

Physics-based computational neuromusculoskeletal models can interpret the dynamic interaction between neural drive to muscles, muscle dynamics, body and joint kinematics and kinetics. Still, such set of solutions suffers from slowness, especially for the complex models, hindering the utility in real-time applications. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to the benefits in speedy and simple implementation, but they cannot reflect the underlying neuromechanical processes. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework for musculoskeletal modelling, where physics-based domain knowledge is brought into the data-driven model as soft constraints to penalise/regularise the data-driven model. We use the synchronous muscle forces and joint kinematics prediction from surface electromyogram (sEMG) as the exemplar to illustrate the proposed framework. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed as the deep neural network to implement the proposed framework. Simultaneously, the physics law between muscle forces and joint kinematics is used the soft constraint.

To learn the temporal dynamics and spatial asymmetry of EEG towards accurate and generalized emotion recognition, we propose TSception, a multi-scale convolutional neural network that can classify emotions from EEG. TSception consists of dynamic temporal, asymmetric spatial, and high-level fusion layers, which learn discriminative representations in the time and channel dimensions simultaneously. The dynamic temporal layer consists of multi-scale 1D convolutional kernels whose lengths are related to the sampling rate of EEG, which learns the dynamic temporal and frequency representations of EEG. The asymmetric spatial layer takes advantage of the asymmetric EEG patterns for emotion, learning the discriminative global and hemisphere representations. The learned spatial representations will be fused by a high-level fusion layer. Using more generalized cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. The performance of the proposed network is compared with prior reported methods such as SVM, KNN, FBFgMDM, FBTSC, Unsupervised learning, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, and EEGNet.

To reduce pollution and maintenance, and ensure cheaper and more convenient flights, industry and academia have directed their efforts toward aircraft electrification. Considering various types of aircraft, several frameworks have been proposed: more-electric aircraft (MEA), hybrid electric aircraft (HEA), and all-electric aircraft (AEA). In the MEA framework, propulsion is generated by a conventional jet engine; however, all secondary systems (hydraulic, pneumatic, and actuation) are electrified. By further increasing electrification, electric motors can provide propulsion with the electric power supplied by the conventional engine (i.e., HEA) or from electrical energy storage (i.e., AEA). Power electronics and electrical machines play a key role in this scenario in which electric power must be efficiently generated, distributed, and consumed to satisfy extremely high requirements of aviation safety.

Specifically, to cope with the heterogeneity of IIoT devices, we develop the DTEI-assisted deep reinforcement learning method for the selection process of IIoT devices in FL, especially for selecting IIoT devices with high utility values. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous FL scheme to address the discrete effects caused by heterogeneous IIoT devices.

Meanwhile, along with the development of communication technology, the attack surface has expanded, and concerns regarding network security have increased. Accordingly, to deal with potential threats, research on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) has been actively conducted. Among the various NIDS technologies, recent interest is focused on artificial intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detection systems, and various models have been proposed to improve the performance of NIDS. However, there still exists the problem of data imbalance, in which AI models cannot sufficiently learn malicious behavior and thus fail to detect network threats accurately. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based NIDS that can efficiently resolve the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of the previous systems. To address the aforementioned problem, we leveraged a state-of-the-art generative model that could generate plausible synthetic data for minor attack traffic. In particular, we focused on the reconstruction error and Wasserstein distance-based generative adversarial networks, and autoencoder-driven deep learning models.

With the help of the hybrid MPPT algorithm (PSO+IC and PSO+PO), the step size is no longer fixed, and it is changing according to the solar irradiance. To evaluate the proposed hybrid algorithm, a single-stage grid connected PV system is designed for several different scenarios with various weather conditions. The performance of the hybrid MPPT algorithm and the conventional methods is compared.

Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets.

A hybrid PV-Wind-FC with electrolyzer consisting of BESS with the least number of control loops and converters has been proposed. The proposed hybrid system presents a cost efficient solution for integrating PV into a hybrid system by eliminating the PV converter. This includes the design of controllers for grid-connected hybrid systems with a renewable distributed generator (Wind and PV) as a primary source, BESS as a secondary source and FC with Electrolyzer as a tertiary source. In addition, the lead compensator along with integrator is used for obtaining enough phase margin and removing steady state error completely. It increases the stability of the controller and adds phase shift  $\varphi _{s}$  at a cross gain frequency ( $\omega _{cut}$ ). The Grid Side Controller (GSC) is capable of providing frequency support to the utility grid, when it is linked to the grid. In the proposed configuration, PV power is maximized and injected into grid through GSC. Rotor Side Converter (RSC) and GSC ensure the support for sharing the burden of the grid station. Moreover, the proposed controller of BESS with coordination of FC eliminates the effect of intermittency of power generated from wind and PV. Excess power production by renewable distribution generation is used by Electrolyzer to generate hydrogen. This hydrogen is further used by FC when there is not enough power generation due to unfavorable weather conditions. The energy management has been presented to fulfill the load profile, avoid BESS overcharging and to minimize the intermittency and fluctuation of Wind and PV sources. This method guarantees steady power flow and service continuity. The Simulink model of the proposed system results validate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid system as compared to the conventional hybrid system reported in the literature.

First, they often suffer from high computational complexity, restricting their feasibility for large-scale datasets. Second, they typically fuse multi-view information via one-stage fusion, neglecting the possibilities in multi-stage fusions. Third, dataset-specific hyperparameter-tuning is frequently required, further undermining their practicability. In light of this, we propose a fast multi-view clustering via ensembles (FastMICE) approach.Particularly, the concept of random view groups is presented to capture the versatile view-wise relationships, through which the hybrid early-late fusion strategy is designed to enable efficient multi-stage fusions. With multiple views extended to many view groups, three levels of diversity (w.r.t. features, anchors, and neighbors, respectively) are jointly leveraged for constructing the view-sharing bipartite graphs in the early-stage fusion. Then, a set of diversified base clusterings for different view groups are obtained via fast graph partitioning, which are further formulated into a unified bipartite graph for final clustering in the late-stage fusion. Notably, FastMICE has almost linear time and space complexity, and is free of dataset-specific tuning. Experiments on 22 multi-view datasets demonstrate its advantages in scalability (for extremely large datasets), superiority (in clustering performance), and simplicity (to be applied) over the state-of-the-art.

With the emergence of large-scale academic datasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable performance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field mainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring for the progress of FAS community. In this paper, to stimulate future research, we present the first comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning based FAS. It covers several novel and insightful components: 1) besides supervision with binary label (e.g., ‘0’ for bonafide versus ‘1’ for PAs), we also investigate recent methods with pixel-wise supervision (e.g., pseudo depth map); 2) in addition to traditional intra-dataset evaluation, we collect and analyze the latest methods specially designed for domain generalization and open-set FAS; and 3) besides commercial RGB camera, we summarize the deep learning applications under multi-modal (e.g., depth and infrared) or specialized (e.g., light field and flash) sensors.

To achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time rendering is the key technology. However, computing intensive tasks of real-time rendering from metaverse service providers cannot be processed efficiently on a single resource-limited mobile device. Alternatively, such mobile devices can offload the metaverse rendering tasks to other mobile devices by adopting the collaborative computing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC). Therefore, this paper introduces a hierarchical game-theoretic CDC framework for the metaverse services, especially for vehicular metaverse. In the framework, idle resources from vehicles, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated to handle intensive computation tasks in the vehicular metaverse. Specifically, in the upper layer, a miner coalition formation game is formulated based on a reputation metric to select reliable workers. To guarantee the reliable management of reputation values, the reputation values calculated based on the subjective logical model are maintained in a blockchain database. In the lower layer, a Stackelberg game based incentive mechanism is considered to attract reliable workers selected in the upper layer to participate in rendering tasks. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to malicious workers. Compared with the baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can improve the utility of metaverse service provider and average profit of CDC workers.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3204839","Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality(grant numbers:2021Szvup092); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001210,62102099); China Scholarship Council; National Research Foundation; Infocomm Media Development Authority; Future Communications Research and Development Programme; AI Singapore Programme(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019); Energy Research Test-Bed and Industry Partnership Funding Initiative; Energy Grid (EG) 2.0 Programme; DesCartes and the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise; Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research; Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute; Singapore Ministry of Education Tier 1(grant numbers:RG16/20); National Research Foundation; Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority; Future Communications Research and Development Programme; SUTD SRG-ISTD-2021-165; SUTD-ZJU IDEA(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU (VP) 202102); SUTD-ZJU IDEA Seed(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU (SD) 202101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9880566","Blockchain;coalition game;incentive mechanism;metaverse;reliable coded distributed computing;Stackelberg game","Metaverse;Reliability;Task analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Mobile handsets;Games;Blockchains","","67","","48","CCBY","7 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, deploying these highly accurate models for data-driven, learned, automatic, and practical machine learning (ML) solutions to end-user applications remains challenging. DL algorithms are often computationally expensive, power-hungry, and require large memory to process complex and iterative operations of millions of parameters. Hence, training and inference of DL models are typically performed on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in the cloud. Data transmission to the cloud results in high latency, round-trip delay, security and privacy concerns, and the inability of real-time decisions. Thus, processing on edge devices can significantly reduce cloud transmission cost. Edge devices are end devices closest to the user, such as mobile phones, cyber–physical systems (CPSs), wearables, the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded and autonomous systems, and intelligent sensors. These devices have limited memory, computing resources, and power-handling capability. Therefore, optimization techniques at both the hardware and software levels have been developed to handle the DL deployment efficiently on the edge. Understanding the existing research, challenges, and opportunities is fundamental to leveraging the next generation of edge devices with artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Mainly, four research directions have been pursued for efficient DL inference on edge devices: 1) novel DL architecture and algorithm design; 2) optimization of existing DL methods; 3) development of algorithm–hardware codesign; and 4) efficient accelerator design for DL deployment.

The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes.

However, need of larger training sets, computational complexity, and overfitting, etc. are the major issues with these techniques that still need to be addressed. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed that consists of smaller number of layers leading to lower computational burden. Some augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are applied to generate additional samples increasing the training set without actually capturing more images. The CNN model is trained for apple crop using a publicly available dataset PlantVillage to identify Scab, Black rot, and Cedar rust diseases in apple leaves. The rigorous experimental results revealed that the proposed model is well fit to identify apple leaf diseases and achieves 98% classification accuracy. It is also evident from the results that it needs lesser amount of storage and takes smaller execution time than several existing deep CNN models. Although, there exist several CNN models for crop disease detection with comparable accuracy, but the proposed model needs lower storage and computational resources.

The best accuracy was achieved with the WA-CNN, a feature-based deep learning algorithm and a combination of two images with overall accuracy (OA) value of 97.89% and the user's accuracy producer's accuracy was from 97% to 99%. To obtain this, first, factor analysis was introduced to decrease the size of the hyperspectral image data cube.

Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely participate due to the rise in deployment standards. This study introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering (SE) for building accessible and reliable foundation models in metaverse, namely, “SE-enabled foundation models in metaverse.” Particularly, the research framework comprises a six-layer architecture (infrastructure layer, operation layer, knowledge layer, intelligence layer, management layer, and interaction layer), which can provide controllability, trustworthiness, and interactivity for the foundation models in metaverse. This creates closed-loop, virtual–real, and human–machine environments that provides the best indices and goals for the foundation models, which allows us to fully validate and calibrate the corresponding models. Then, examples of use cases from the automotive industry are listed to provide transparency on the possible use and benefits of our approach.

However, the existing collective opinion generation approaches fail to model the behavioral characteristics associated with individuals, and thus, cannot reflect the fairness concerns among them when they consciously or unconsciously incorporate their judgments on the fairness level of distribution into the formulations of individual opinions. In this study, we propose a multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach that generalizes the bi-objective optimization-based PDF aggregation paradigm. In doing so, we adapt the notion of fairness concern utility function to characterize the influence of fairness inclusion and take its maximization as an additional objective, together with the criteria of consensus and confidence levels, to achieve in generating collective opinion. The formulation of fairness concern is then transformed into the congregation of individual fairness concern utilities in the use of aggregation functions. We regard the generalized extended Bonferroni mean (BM) as an elaborated framework for aggregating individual fairness concern utilities. In such way, we establish the concept of BM-type collective fairness concern utility to empower multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach with the capacity of modeling different structures associated with the expert group with fairness concern. The application of the proposed fairness-aware framework in the maturity assessment of building information modeling demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of multiobjective optimization-driven approach for generating collective opinion when accomplishing complicated assessment and evaluation tasks with data scarcity.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2023.3273715","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171182,72031009,MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033,PID2019-103880RB-I00); Andalusian Government(grant numbers:P2000673); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127856","Collective opinion generation;fairness concern;multiobjective optimization;probability distribution function (PDF)","Behavioral sciences;Optimization;Task analysis;Probability distribution;Bayes methods;Probabilistic logic;Probability density function","","64","","65","CCBY","17 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even if studies on the vision of the 6G network have already been published, there is still a significant amount of ground to cover. There is no decision made yet regarding anything, and nothing has been ruled out. The focus of this study is to identify a complete picture of changes in architectures, technologies, and challenges that will shape the 6G network. The research results will provide indications for further studies on 6G ecosystems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3269297","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN-2022-3256); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106261","6G;architecture;5G new radio;mobile network;artificial intelligence;technologies;challenges","6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Terminology;Security;Quantum communication","","58","","154","CCBYNCND","21 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The consequent limitations in flexibility, scalability, and adaptability of optical networks will become increasingly important with new applications, such as 5G/6G. Coherent transceivers based on digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) are proposed to address these current constraints. In particular, DSCM allows (i) the design of high-capacity point-to-point (P2P) and -multipoint (P2MP) optical networks; (ii) simplified aggregation with passive optics; and (iii) connections between low- and high-speed transceivers. Furthermore, DSCM-based networks reduce the number of opto-electro-opto stages, halve the number of bookended transceivers, and provide a better match for existing hub-and-spoke (H&S) traffic patterns in fast-growing and dynamic access/metro segments. A DSCM-based transceiver will pave the way for the deployment of next-generation flexible, adaptable, and scalable software-configurable optical networks. Key steps and elements to realize this solution are laid out, and promising applications outlined.

Blockchain technology is emerging as one of the main alternatives when it comes to finding a balance in the healthcare ecosystem. However, the constant development of new Blockchain technologies and the evolution of healthcare systems make it difficult to find established proposals. From an architectural point of view, the design of blockchain-based solutions requires trade-offs e.g., security and interoperability. This paper focuses on two main objectives, in the first one, it was carried out a Systematic Literature Review for exploring architectural mechanisms used to support the interoperability and security of Blockchain-based Health Management Systems. Taking into account of results, a series of scenarios were generated where these mechanisms can be used along with their context, issues, and various architectural concerns (interoperability and security).

These antennas have recently gained the attention of researchers and have received a great deal of popularity due to their attractive characteristics and opportunities. They are fundamental in the Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) for health care, military, sports, and identification purposes. Compared to traditional antennas, these antennas work in close proximity to the human body, so their performance in terms of return loss, gain, directivity, bandwidth, radiation pattern, efficiency, and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is influenced by the coupling and absorption of the human body tissues. Additionally, in the design of these antennas, size, power consumption, and speed can also play a paramount role. In most cases, these antennas are integrated into the clothes, or in some cases, they may be fixed over the skin of the users. When these characteristics are considered, the design of wearable antennas becomes challenging, particularly when textile materials are examined, high conductivity materials are used during the manufacturing process, and various deformation scenarios have an impact on the design’s performance. To enhance the overall performance of the wearable antennas and to reduce the backward radiation towards the human body, metamaterial surfaces are introduced that provide a high degree of isolation from the human body and significantly reduce the SAR. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art wearable/textile/flexible antennas integrated with metamaterial structures composed of wearable/flexible substrate materials, with a focus on single and dual band antenna designs. The paper also reviews the critical design issues, various fabrication techniques, and other factors that need to be considered in the design of wearable/textile/flexible antennas.

Although the Internet of Terrestrial Things (IoTT) has been at the center of our IoT perception, it has been recently extended to different environments, such as the Internet of Underwater Things (IoWT), the Internet of Biomedical Things (IoBT), and Internet of Underground Things (IoGT). Even though radio frequency (RF) based wireless networks are regarded as the default means of connectivity, they are not always the best option due to the limited spectrum, interference limitations caused by the ever-increasing number of devices, and severe propagation loss in transmission mediums other than air. As a remedy, optical wireless communication (OWC) technologies can complement, replace, or co-exist with audio and radio wave-based wireless systems to improve overall network performance. To this aim, this paper reveals the full potential of OWC-based IoT networks by providing a top-down survey of four main IoT domains: IoTT, IoWT, IoBT, and IoGT. Each domain is covered by a dedicated and self-contained section that starts with a comparative analysis, explains how OWC can be hybridized with existing wireless technologies, points out potential OWC applications fitting best the related IoT domain, and discusses open communication and networking research problems.

When dispatched on autonomous missions, drones require an intelligent decision-making system for trajectory planning and tour optimization. Given the limited capacity of their onboard batteries, a key design challenge is to ensure the underlying algorithms can efficiently optimize the mission objectives along with recharging operations during long-haul flights. With this in view, the present work undertakes a comprehensive study on automated tour management systems for an energy-constrained drone: (1) We construct a machine learning model that estimates the energy expenditure of typical multi-rotor drones while accounting for real-world aspects and extrinsic meteorological factors. (2) Leveraging this model, the joint program of flight mission planning and recharging optimization is formulated as a multi-criteria Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), wherein a drone seeks for the time-optimal energy-feasible tour that visits all the target sites and refuels whenever necessary. (3) We devise an efficient approximation algorithm with provable worst-case performance guarantees and implement it in a drone management system, which supports real-time flight path tracking and re- computation in dynamic environments. (4) The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach are validated through extensive numerical simulations as well as real-world experiments. Note to Practitioners—This study is stimulated by the need for developing pragmatic and provably efficient automated tour management systems for UAVs deployed on energy-constrained, long-distance flight missions. As such, UAVs provide a nifty platform for facilitating environmental monitoring, disaster management, transport of medical supplies, as well as expediting last-mile deliveries. However, existing path planners generally fall short of capturing several crucial aspects, such as detailed power consumption model (e.g., factoring in payload, wind speed and direction) or performance guarantees, potentially leading to underutilized or infeasible routing decisions. To address these issues, the present work proposes a theoretically-backed routing approach with a certifiable degree of optimality and develops an effective, practical power consumption evaluation model for multi-rotor UAVs, verified on multiple drone models.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3175565","Khalifa University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:CIRA-2020-286); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779119","Unmanned aerial vehicles;flight mission planning;recharging optimization;power consumption modeling;approximation algorithm;traveling salesman problem","Drones;Batteries;Routing;Planning;Power demand;Charging stations;Approximation algorithms","","56","","45","CCBY","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its many advantages, it faces significant challenges, such as detecting abnormal behaviours in the grid. Identifying anomalous behaviours helps to discover unusual user power consumption, faulty infrastructure, power outages, equipment failures, energy thefts, or cyberattacks. Machine learning (ML)-based techniques on smart meter data has shown remarkable results in anomaly detection. However, traditional ML-based anomaly detection requires smart meters to share local data with a central server, which raises concerns regarding data security and user privacy. Server-based model training faces additional challenges, such as the requirement of centralised computing power, reliable network communication, large bandwidth capacity, and latency issues, all of which affect the real-time anomaly detection performance. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a Federated Learning (FL)-based smart grid anomaly detection scheme where ML models are trained locally in smart meters without sharing data with a central server, thus ensuring user privacy. In the proposed approach, a global model is downloaded from the server to smart meters for on-device training. After local training, local model parameters are sent to the server to improve the global model. We secure the model parameter updates from adversaries using the SSL/TLS protocol. Using standard datasets, we investigate the anomaly detection performance of federated learning and observe that FL models achieve anomaly detection performance comparable to centralised ML models while ensuring user privacy. Further, our study shows that the proposed FL-based models perform efficiently in terms of memory, CPU usage, bandwidth and power consumption at edge devices and are suitable for implementation in resource-constrained environments, such as smart meters, for anomaly detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3237554","Singapore’s National Research Foundation(grant numbers:NRF-CRP20-2017-0006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018378","Anomaly detection;cybersecurity;data analysis;federated learning;Internet of Things;machine learning;neural networks;smart grid;smart meter","Anomaly detection;Smart meters;Data models;Smart grids;Servers;Machine learning;Federated learning;Internet of Things","","55","","80","CCBY","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For large parking, it is desirable to use a cenital-plane camera located at a high distance that allows the monitoring of the entire parking space or a large parking area with only one camera. Today’s most popular object detection models, such as YOLO, achieve good precision scores at real-time speed. However, if we use our own data different from that of the general-purpose datasets, such as COCO and ImageNet, we have a large margin for improvisation. In this paper, we propose a modified, yet lightweight, deep object detection model based on the YOLO-v5 architecture. The proposed model can detect large, small, and tiny objects. Specifically, we propose the use of a multi-scale mechanism to learn deep discriminative feature representations at different scales and automatically determine the most suitable scales for detecting objects in a scene (i.e., in our case vehicles). The proposed multi-scale module reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to the original YOLO-v5 architecture. The experimental results also demonstrate that precision is improved by a large margin. In fact, as shown in the experiments, the results show a small reduction from 7.28 million parameters of the YOLO-v5-S profile to 7.26 million parameters in our model. In addition, we reduced the detection speed by inferring 30 fps compared to the YOLO-v5-L/X profiles. In addition, the tiny vehicle detection performance was significantly improved by 33% compared to the YOLO-v5-X profile.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137638","Industrial Doctorate modality (018 DI 054) with Universitat Rovira i Virgili and Quercus Technologies collaboration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9658533","Convolutional neural networks;tiny objects;smart parking","Object detection;Cameras;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Automobiles;Convolutional neural networks;Detectors","","55","","28","CCBY","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Clinical evaluation of skin lesions is essential, but it faces challenges such as long waiting times and subjective interpretations. Deep learning techniques have been developed to tackle these challenges and assist dermatologists in making more accurate diagnoses. Prompt treatment of skin cancer is vital to prevent its progression and potentially life-threatening consequences. The use of deep learning algorithms can improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, leading to earlier detection and treatment. Additionally, it can reduce the workload for healthcare professionals, allowing them to concentrate on more complex cases. The goal of this study was to develop reliable deep learning (DL) prediction models for skin cancer classification; (i) deal with a typical severe class imbalance problem, which arises because the skin-affected patients’ class is significantly smaller than the healthy class; and (ii) interpret the model output to better understand the decision-making mechanism (iii) Propose an End-to-End smart healthcare system through an android application. In a comparison examination with six well-known classifiers, the effectiveness of the proposed DL technique was explored in terms of metrics relating to both generalization capability and classification accuracy. A study used the HAM10000 dataset and an optimized CNN to identify the seven forms of skin cancer. The model was trained using two optimization functions (Adam and RMSprop) and three activation functions (Relu, Swish, and Tanh). Furthermore, an XAI-based skin lesion classification system was developed, incorporating Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ to explain the model’s decisions. This system can help doctors make informed skin cancer diagnoses in their early stages, with an 82% classification accuracy and 0.47% loss accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3269694","JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP23H03477; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107401","Skin cancer;explainable AI;CNN;Grad-CAM;Grad-CAM++","Skin cancer;Cancer;Skin;Lesions;Biological system modeling;Artificial intelligence;Predictive models","","55","","34","CCBYNCND","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It utilizes a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of satellite images and then feeds the results to a SHAP deep explainer so as to strengthen the classification results. The proposed framework is applied to Sentinel-2 satellite images containing 27000 images of pixel size  $64 \times 64$  and operates on three-band combinations, reducing the model’s input data by 77% considering that 13 channels are available, while at the same time investigating on how different spectrum bands affect predictions on the dataset’s classes. Experimental results on the EuroSAT dataset demonstrate the CNN’s accurate classification with an overall accuracy of 94.72 %, whereas the classification accuracy on three-band combinations on each of the dataset’s classes highlights its improvement when compared to standard approaches with larger number of trainable parameters. The SHAP explainable results of the proposed framework shield the network’s predictions by showing correlation values that are relevant to the predicted class, thereby improving the classifications occurring in urban and rural areas with different land uses in the same scene.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2023.3251652","European Union Funded Project “Improved Resilience and Sustainable Reconstruction of Cultural Heritage Areas to cope with Climate Change and Other Hazards based on Innovative Algorithms and Modeling Tools” under the Horizon 2020 Program H2020-EU.3.5.6(grant numbers:872931); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057399","Convolutional neural network (CNN);EuroSAT;explainable AI (XAI);land cover;land use;remote sensing;Shapley additive explanation (SHAP)","Remote sensing;Convolutional neural networks;Correlation;Additives;Deep learning;Crops;Standards","","55","","29","CCBY","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we show how large language models (LLMs), such as generative pretrained transformer (GPT), can augment the early phases of innovation, in particular, exploration, ideation, and digital prototyping. Drawing on six months of experimenting with LLMs in internal and client innovation projects, we share first-hand experiences and concrete examples of AI-assisted approaches. The article highlights a large variety of use cases for generative AI ranging from user journey mapping to idea generation and prototyping and foreshadows the promising role LLMs may play in future knowledge management systems. Moreover, we argue that generative AI may become a game changer in early prototyping as the delegation of tasks to an artificial agent can result in faster iterations and reduced costs. Our experiences also provide insights into how human innovation teams purposively and effectively interact with AIs and integrate them into their workflows.","1937-4178","","10.1109/EMR.2023.3272799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115412","AI-augmented innovation management;artificial intelligence (AI);digital prototyping;generative AI;idea generation;innovation;large language model (LLM);need identification;no-code prototyping;UX/UI","Artificial intelligence;Technological innovation;Chatbots;Codes;Prototypes;Task analysis;Companies","","55","","10","CCBY","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Out of many renewable sources, solar energy sources that are clean, green, and emissions-free have gained wide utilization despite their intermittency nature. Several solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are connected in parallel to achieve the energy demand. In such a system, each panel operates differently due to uneven temperature and irradiation, resulting in a uniform and partial shading conditions. Thus, a unique and efficient mechanism is required to extract maximum power from uniformly and partially shaded PV systems. Many researchers across the world have developed various maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques to increase the efficiency and lifetime of PV systems. This study provides a unique, in-depth, and organized review of MPPT methods under four categories: classical, intelligent, optimization, and hybrid techniques. All possible selection benchmarks are considered to do a comprehensive review, which is not deliberated in the existing review literature. Based on the selection benchmarks, the advantages and disadvantages of each MPPT technique under different categories are summarized in tabulated form. To address the research gaps for further investigation in this field, a concise discussion is included at the end. This review article may find an accessible reference for engineers to understand the most useful MPPT method and to undertake extensive research in PV systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3262502","Universidad Panamericana through the Project “Estudio de topologías de convertidores de cd-cd”(grant numbers:UP-CI-2022-GDL-06-ING); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083133","Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques;renewable energy source;solar photovoltaics (PV);partial shading condition (PSC);global maximum power point (GMPP)","Maximum power point trackers;Renewable energy sources;Photovoltaic systems;Optimization;Radiation effects;Classification algorithms;Benchmark testing","","55","","163","CCBYNCND","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

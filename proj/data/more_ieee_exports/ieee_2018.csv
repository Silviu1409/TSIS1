This is especially true of mobile payments, which are attracting increasing attention. However, the occurrence of many traditional financial mishaps has exposed the challenges inherent in online authentication technology that is based on traditional modes of realizing the healthy and stable development of mobile payment. In addition, this technology ensures user account security and privacy. In this paper, we propose a Secure Mutual Authentication Protocol (SMAP) based on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol for mobile payment. To guarantee reliable service, we use an asymmetric cryptosystem for achieving mutual authentication between the server and client, which can resist fake servers and forged terminals. Compared to the modes currently used, the proposed protocol strengthens the security of user account information as well as individual privacy throughout the mobile-payment transaction process. Practical application has proven the security and convenience of the proposed protocol.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450873","mutual authentication; security; privacy; Universal 2nd Factor (U2F); mobile payment","Authentication;Protocols;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Universal Serial Bus","","24","","","","16 Sep 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To address this issue, a security policy of big data analysis has been proposed based on the analysis of log data of servers and terminals in Spark. However, in practical applications, Spark cannot suitably analyze very huge amounts of log data. To address this problem, we propose a scheduling optimization technique based on the reuse of datasets to improve Spark performance. In this technique, we define and formulate the reuse degree of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Spark based on Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then, we define a global optimization function to obtain the optimal DAG sequence, that is, the sequence with the least execution time. To implement the global optimization function, we further propose a novel cost optimization algorithm based on the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our experiments demonstrate that this scheduling optimization technique in Spark can greatly decrease the time overhead of analyzing log data for detecting APT attacks.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450868","Spark; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT); schedule; reuse; Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD);Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); Genetic Algorithm (GA)","Sparks;Optimization;Scheduling;Security;Genetic algorithms;Big Data;Scheduling algorithms","","10","","","","16 Sep 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Existing approaches use a password manager and encrypted Web application to protect passwords and other sensitive data; however, they may be compromised or lack accessibility. The paper presents SecureWeb, which is a secure, practical, and user-controllable framework for mitigating the leakage of sensitive data.

Here, a new primitive called Revocable Hierarchical Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (RHIBBE) is formalized that allows revocation of the HIBBE.

Therefore, this study involves proposing a precise and rapid technique to identify the fault section in an LVDC distribution system. The technique involves two stages, namely: an analysis stage to analyze the capacitive discharge current and a decision stage to identify the fault section based on the fault type.

Thus, we perform device pairing without complicated operations. SDP dynamically adjusts the sensor’s sampling frequency and uses different classifiers at varying stages to save the energy. A multi-level quantization algorithm is used to maximize the mutual information between two communicating entities without information leakage. We evaluate the main modules of SDP with 1800 sets of handshake data.

In this letter, we exploit deep learning to handle wireless OFDM channels in an end-to-end manner. Different from existing OFDM receivers that first estimate channel state information (CSI) explicitly and then detect/recover the transmitted symbols using the estimated CSI, the proposed deep learning-based approach estimates CSI implicitly and recovers the transmitted symbols directly. To address channel distortion, a deep learning model is first trained offline using the data generated from simulation based on channel statistics and then used for recovering the online transmitted data directly. From our simulation results, the deep learning based approach can address channel distortion and detect the transmitted symbols with performance comparable to the minimum mean-square error estimator. Furthermore, the deep learning-based approach is more robust than conventional methods when fewer training pilots are used, the cyclic prefix is omitted, and nonlinear clipping noise exists. In summary, deep learning is a promising tool for channel estimation and signal detection in wireless communications with complicated channel distortion and interference.","2162-2345","","10.1109/LWC.2017.2757490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8052521","Deep learning;channel estimation;OFDM","Machine learning;OFDM;Channel estimation;Data models;Wireless communication;Training;Nonlinear distortion","","1360","","10","OAPA","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To resolve this problem, this letter proposes a single-stage switched-capacitor module (S3CM) topology for cascaded multilevel inverter, which ensures the peak inverse voltage across all the switches within the dc source voltage. A total of nine voltage levels can be generated with only one dc source and two incorporated capacitors. Hence, the number of isolated dc sources is significantly reduced compared to a cascaded H-bridge. In addition, voltage boosting gain of two is achieved. A comparative analysis of the recent topology reveals that the proposed S3CM topology achieves switch count reduction.

Besides, the measurements invariably are tainted with noise which makes the problem of estimating the actual states of the system more difficult. The most common way of solving this issue involves the application of the Kalman Filter (KF) or the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), for linear and nonlinear systems, respectively; although in both cases, the estimation heavily relies on linear techniques. In a different way, the James-Stein Filter provides a robust approach to estimate linear and nonlinear systems under parametric uncertainties of the mathematical model. In this brief note, a slightly different James-Stein State Estimator (JSSE), named Modified James-Stein State Estimator (JSSE-M), is presented as an alternative to filtering the states of nonlinear systems within a control scheme. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of performance between KF, EKF, JSSE, and JSSE-M when they are used on a relatively complex nonlinear system which is extremely dependent on its parameters, namely the quadrotor.

To simultaneously monitor heartbeat and respiration, the proposed textile is sewn on to the clothes to be able to sense minute load changes produced by chest movements. The vital signs, which were calculated from the heartbeat and respiration frequency of a healthy adult, while sitting, were in agreement with those verified using commercial monitoring devices. In addition, to confirm the capability of monitoring vital signs, seven monitoring trials were performed in which the subjects were asked to wear and take off the smart cloth.

In the proposed asymmetric multilevel inverter, dc sources are replaced with the switched capacitor unit, which in turn boosts the output voltage and produces twice the voltage levels at the loads.

A novel unit cell based on a wideband bandpass filter is developed and applied to the design of the TA. The TA consists of two identical trilayer frequency selective surfaces (FSSs), thus it has a lower profile compared to traditional designs that use at least four FSS layers separated by quarter-wavelength air gaps to obtain the 360° phase shift range. The FSS has a pair of square patches printed on the top and bottom layers, and a square slot loaded by four microstrip lines printed on the middle layer. The phase shift is achieved by simultaneously adjusting the size of the square patches. Within the frequency band of interest, the developed unit cell shows low insertion loss and sufficient phase shift range. An equivalent circuit model is developed to better understand the operating principles of the FSS. To validate the design concept, one prototype operating at 13.5 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measurement results show that the designed TA achieves 16% 1 dB gain bandwidth and 60% aperture efficiency.

As a result, it is found that the breakdown voltage is enhanced particularly in the cases with relatively shortfield plates because the reduction in the electric field at the drain edge of gate effectively improves the breakdown voltage in the case with the high-k passivation layer. In the case with the moderate-length field plate, the enhancement of breakdown voltage due to the high-k passivation layer occurs because the electric field profiles between the field-plate edge and the drain become more uniform. It is also studied how the breakdown voltage depends on a deep-acceptor density in the Fe-doped semiinsulating buffer layer when a high-k passivation layer is used. It is shown that the breakdown voltage increases with increasing the relative permittivity of the passivation layer εr and with increasing the deep-acceptor density NDA. When εr = 60 and NDA = 2-3 × 1017 cm-3 at the gate length of 0.3 μm, the breakdown voltage becomes about 500 V at a gate-to-drain distance of 1.5 μm, which corresponds to an average electric field of about 3.3 MV/cm between the gate and the drain.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2018.2857774","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP16K06314); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8423447","2-D analysis;breakdown characteristics;buffer layer;GaN HEMT;high-k passivation layer","Passivation;Logic gates;Aluminum gallium nitride;Wide band gap semiconductors;HEMTs;MODFETs;High-k dielectric materials","","80","","29","OAPA","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since at the moment no commercially available gate drivers for these specifications exist, a customized isolated gate driver is developed, which, in order to simplify the use of the high-voltage SiC devices, is intended to be integrated into a future intelligent MV SiC module.

A high dense dielectric patch antenna is utilized as a radiating element instead of a metallic patch in order to gain several significant advantages, including low profile, wide bandwidth, and high radiation efficiency. The implemented antenna is excited by an aperture-coupled feeding technique. The antenna gain is enhanced by using a highly reflective FSS superstrate layer, realizing an antenna gain enhancement of 11 dBi. The implemented antenna acquired a measured gain of about 17.78 dBi at 28 GHz with a 9% bandwidth and radiation efficiency of 90%. The bandwidth of the proposed antenna is improved by using a unit cell printed on two sides, as it provides a positive phase gradient over the desired frequency range.

RF fingerprint of wireless device has physical characteristics, which is difficult to clone. Therefore, it can be used for D2D device recognition.

Weighted GIF and gradient-domain GIF try to address the problem by incorporating an edge-aware weighting into GIF. However, they are very sensitive to the regularization parameter and the halo artifacts will become serious as the regularization parameter increases. Moreover, noise in the background is often amplified because of the fixed amplification factor for the detail layer. In this letter, an effective GIF is proposed for better contrast enhancement. First, the average of local variances for all pixels is incorporated into the cost function of GIF for preserving the edges accurately in the base layer. Second, the amplification factor for the detail layer is calculated in a content-adaptive way for suppressing the noise while boosting the fine details. Experimental results show that the proposed filter is more robust to the regularization parameter and can produce visually pleasing output images.

In current methods based on harmonic analysis, a sound field is decomposed into harmonic functions with a center given in advance, which is called a global origin, and their coefficients are obtained up to a certain truncation order using microphone measurements. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed sound field depends on the predefined position of the global origin and the truncation order, which makes it difficult to apply this technique to an asymmetric array since the criterion to determine the position of the global origin and the truncation order is not obvious. We formulate an estimate of the harmonic coefficients on the basis of infinite-order analysis. This formulation enables us to estimate the harmonic coefficients at an arbitrary desired position independently of the position of the global origin without truncation errors.

The stress effects of all the devices were carefully considered in terms of carrier mobility and velocity averaged within the active regions. For detailed AC analysis, the parasitic capacitances were extracted and decomposed into several components using TCAD RF simulation platform. FinFETs improved the gate electrostatics by decreasing fin widths to 5 nm, but the fin heights were unable to improve RC delay due to the trade-off between on-state currents and gate capacitances. The NSFETs have better on-state currents than do the FinFETs because of larger effective widths (Weff) under the same device area. Particularly p-type NSFETs have larger compressive stress within the active regions affected by metal gate encircling all around the channels, thus improving carrier mobility and velocity much. On the other hand, the NSFETs have larger gate capacitances because larger Weff increase the gate-to-source/drain overlap and outerfringing capacitances.

The effect of the slits is indirect by improving the impedance matching, which creates a room for isolation enhancement through rigorous optimization of all antenna parameters. The results obtained for an exemplary antenna structure indicate the advantages of increasing the slit complexity as well as a saturation effect beyond n = 3. Using these considerations, a compact MIMO antenna is developed and optimized to operate in the ultrawideband (UWB) (3.1-10.6 GHz) frequency range.

The limited NS spacing, which allows TiN capping layer only, makes different WF between the edge and the middle part of NS circumference. Unfortunately, this causes non-linear Vth shifts and dc performance degradation as a function of WF due to one-side turn-on phenomena between the edge and the middle part. Furthermore, the fixed WF of TiN capping layer limits Vth shifts toward ultra-low-power applications. To enable multi-Vth of NSFETs, several possible solutions are addressed: changing the Nch and the WF of TiN capping layer. The higher Nch enables lower off-state current while 50-nm-wide three-stacked NS decreases dc performance variations effectively. Changing the WF of TiN capping layer can extend Vth margins, but degrade DC performance as a trade-off. Nonetheless, 7-nm node NSFETs adopting these techniques have multi-Vth options to satisfy wide ranges from ultra-low-power to high-performance applications.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2859799","Korea Evaluation Institute of Industrial Technology(grant numbers:10080617); Korea Semiconductor Research Consortium Support Program for the Development of the Future Semiconductor Device; National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1C1B5017795); IC Design Education Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419236","7-nm node;nanosheet FET (NSFET);nanosheet spacing;work-function metal;multi-Vth;TiN capping layer","Tin;Logic gates;Mathematical model;FinFETs;Doping","","56","","20","OAPA","25 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The unit cell of the proposed PC metasurface (PCM) consists of square and  $L$ -shaped patches separated by an  $L$ -shaped slot printed on an FR4 substrate. The mechanisms for linear to circular polarization and bandwidth improvement of a conventional antenna are analyzed theoretically. Through numerical optimizations and parametric studies, a simulated 10-dB impedance bandwidth of 42.7% (4.15–6.4 GHz) and a 3-dB AR bandwidth of 26.2% (4.8–6.25 GHz) are achieved by the proposed antenna. As the simulation demonstrates, the proposed antenna achieves an average 20-dB RCS reduction in a wide band from 5.25 to 6.8 GHz compared with a conventional slot antenna covered by the PC band. In addition, compared with the previously reported work, the PCM-based CP antenna exhibits a larger 3-dB AR beam width of 200° in the xoz plane and 120° in the yoz plane, and a wider CP bandwidth within the operational bandwidth.

As the third current harmonics can be much reduced by virtual voltage vectors automatically, the harmonic items in the cost function of conventional FCS-MPCC are not considered. Furthermore, an adaptive control set is proposed based on voltage prediction. Best control set with proper voltage vector amplitude corresponding to different rotor speed can be achieved by this method. Consequently, current ripples can be largely reduced and the system performs much better.

We present the characterization and analysis over the temperature range from 4 K to 300 K of both substrate bipolar PNP transistors and MOS transistors in standard and dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) configurations implemented in a standard 0.16-μm CMOS technology. These results demonstrate that employing MOS or DTMOS enables the operation of bandgap references and temperature sensors in standard CMOS technologies even at deep-cryogenic temperatures.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2798281","Intel Corporations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8269294","Characterization;cryogenics;substrate bipolar transistors;CMOS;dynamic-threshold MOS;bandgap references;temperature sensors","Temperature sensors;Standards;MOSFET;Current measurement;Photonic band gap;Substrates;Temperature measurement","","41","","29","CCBY","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the size of shadow image, in those schemes, secret image pixels are embedded in all coefficients of (k -1)-degree polynomial to generate the shadows. Also, the secret pixels are permuted before the sharing to address the residual-image problem on shadow images. Due to the above two approaches, partial secret information can be exposed from (k - 1) shadow images, and thus the threshold properties of those schemes will be compromised. To overcome this weakness, we propose a novel (k, n)-SIS scheme based on encrypted pixels, whose shadow image size is slightly larger than that of Thien and Lin's scheme.

However, the fluctuation and intermittent nature of wind not only results in substantial reliability and stability defects, but it also weakens the competitiveness of wind generation in the electric power market. Meanwhile, the way to further enhance the system reliability effectively improving market profits of wind farms is one of the most important aspects of Wind-ESS joint operational design. In this paper, a market-oriented optimized dispatching strategy for a wind farm with a multiple stage hybrid ESS is proposed. The first stage ESS is designed to improve the profits of wind generation through day-ahead market operations, the real-time market-based second stage ESS is focused on day-ahead forecasting error elimination and wind power fluctuation smoothing, while the backup stage ESS is associated with them to provide the ancillary service. An interval forecasting method is adopted to help to ensure reliable forecast results of day-ahead wind power, electricity prices and loads. With this hybrid ESS design, supply reliability and market profits are simultaneously achieved for wind farms.","2096-0042","","10.17775/CSEEJPES.2018.00130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591998","Dispatching optimization;energy storage;integrated energy power systems;interval forecasting;power market;p2g;wind power generation","Wind power generation;Forecasting;Wind forecasting;Reliability;Wind farms;Dispatching;Energy storage","","40","","","","30 Dec 2018","","","CSEE","CSEE Journals"

ETO construction supplier companies consistently consist of off-site and on-site production elements. On-site construction processes are prone to high variability and unpredictability. This uncertainty makes supply chain synchronization for maintaining construction progress difficult. As a result, construction supply chains are characterized by high levels of intermediate buffers and long lead-times. We propose a variety of Industry 4.0 concepts to ameliorate these problems. Initial applications are identified from previous works. Additionally, we present some case studies for some lessons learned from the collaboration with ETO-companies.

Space-division multiplexing (SDM) is considered as a promising solution to overcome the optical network capacity crunch and support cost-effective network capacity scaling. Multi-core fiber (MCF) is regarded as the most feasible and efficient way to realize SDM networks, and its deployment inside data centers seems very likely as the issue of inter-core crosstalk (XT) is not severe over short link spans (<1 km) compared to that in long-haul transmission. However, XT can still have a considerable effect in MCF over short distances,which can limit the transmission reach and in turn the data center’s size. XT can be further reduced by bi-directional transmission of optical signals in adjacent MCF cores. This paper evaluates the benefits of MCF-based SDM solutions in terms of maximizing the capacity and spatial efficiency of data center networks. To this end, we present an analytical model for XT in bi-directional normal step-index and trench-assisted MCFs and propose corresponding XT-aware core prioritization schemes. We further develop XT-aware spectrum resource allocation strategies aimed at relieving the complexity of online XT computation. These strategies divide the available spectrum into disjoint bands and incrementally add them to the pool of accessible resources based on the network conditions. Several combinations of core mapping and spectrum resource allocation algorithms are investigated for eight types of homogeneous MCFs comprising 7–61 cores, three different multiplexing schemes, and three data center network topologies with two traffic scenarios. Extensive simulation results showthat combining bi-directional transmission in dense core fibers with tailored resource allocation schemes significantly increases the network capacity. Moreover, a multiplexing scheme that combines SDM and WDM can achieve up to 33 times higher link spatial efficiency and up to 300 times greater capacity compared to a WDM solution.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8336681","Bi-directional transmission;Data center;Inter-core crosstalk;Link spatial efficiency;Multi-core fiber;Resource allocation algorithm.","Optical fiber networks;Crosstalk;Bidirectional control;Resource management;Wavelength division multiplexing;Data centers","","36","","","","12 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several powerful experimental results of electromagnetic interference(EMI) in voltage source inverter(VSI) with SiC and Si devices are provided. As far as the influence of switching actions is concerned: faster switching speed will generate higher EMI noise levels in the high frequency range, and ringing in the device switching will also make the EMI noise near the ringing frequency range worse. In the meantime, increasing of the switching frequency of the inverter will result in a higher EMI noise peak for the whole EMI spectrum. In order to suppress the EMI noise of the converter to meet standards, Random PWM(RPWM) and EMI filters are adopted. With RPWM, the EMI current can drop a few more dB than that with SVPWM, which makes the filter work better. Also, as extra attenuation can be provided, it provides the benefit of reducing the weight and volume of the inductor of the filter. Therefore, the combination of an advanced modulation strategy and EMI filter is proposed for suppressing of EMI noise in an inverter.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2018.8471288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8471288","Motor drive;EMI;SiC;ringing;EMI filter;PWM","Electromagnetic interference;Switches;Switching frequency;Inverters;Silicon carbide;Silicon","","35","","","","27 Sep 2018","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Second, we use the modified morphological opening operation for estimating the transmission map. In this way, the halo effects are greatly suppressed, and it costs less time than the specially designed filters.

Herein, to improve photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, and increase the lifetime of the battery, a microcontroller-based battery charge controller with maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is designed for harvesting the maximum power available from the PV system under given insolation and temperature conditions. Among different MPPT techniques, perturb and observe (P&O) technique gives excellent results and thus is used.

However, manual analysis of EEG data requires highly trained clinicians or neurophysiologists and is a procedure that is known to have relatively low inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and rate at which new data is acquired makes interpretation a time-consuming, resource hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated analysis offers the potential to improve the quality of patient care by shortening the time to diagnosis, reducing manual error, and automatically detecting debilitating events. In this paper, we focus on one of the early decisions made in this process which is identifying whether an EEG session is normal or abnormal. Unlike previous approaches, we do not extract hand-engineered features but employ deep neural networks that automatically learn meaningful representations. We undertake a holistic study by exploring various pre-processing techniques and machine learning algorithms for addressing this problem and compare their performance. We have used the recently released “TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus” dataset for evaluating the performance of these algorithms. We show that modern deep gated recurrent neural networks achieve 3.47% better performance than previously reported results.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512756","Electroencephalogram;Deep Learning;Recurrent Neural Networks;Epilepsy","Electroencephalography;Training;Feature extraction;Recurrent neural networks;Spectrogram;Logistics;Convolution","Algorithms;Deep Learning;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","30","","12","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The V2G process is first formulated as an optimal control problem. Then, a two-stage V2G discharging control scheme is proposed. In the first stage, a desired level for peak shaving and duration for V2G service are determined off-line based on forecasted loading profile and PEV mobility model. In the second stage, the discharging rates of PEVs are dynamically adjusted in real time by considering the actual grid load and the characteristics of PEVs connected to the grid. The optimal and proposed V2G algorithms are tested using a real residential distribution transformer and PEV mobility data collected from field with different battery and charger ratings for heuristic user case scenarios. The peak shaving performance is assessed in terms of peak shaving index and peak load reduction. Proposed solution is shown to be competitive with the optimal solution while avoiding high computational loads. The impact of the V2G management strategy on the system loading at night is also analyzed by implementing an off-line charging scheduling algorithm.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0375-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8894235","Distribution transformer;Optimal discharging control;Peak shaving;Plug-in electric vehicles;Vehicle-to-grid","Vehicle-to-grid;Batteries;Heuristic algorithms;State of charge;Loading","","28","","","","7 Nov 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

As a result, the degradation mechanism of shorter channel length a-IGZO thin film transistors is due to oxygen-vacancies which are located between the channel and the source/drain junction.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2837682","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST-103-2112-M-110-011-MY3,105CE03); Southern Taiwan Science Park Bureau; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8360776","Bottom gate TFTs;indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO);oxygen vacancy;drain induced barrier lowing (DIBL)","Thin film transistors;Logic gates;Annealing;Degradation;Threshold voltage;Atmospheric measurements","","26","","35","OAPA","17 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A review on how the EEG signals get affected by the consumption of alcohol and the extraction of features from these signals help to differentiate alcoholic and uninfluenced people with the help of graphical user interface (GUI) is presented in this paper. GUI is an interface that showcases the features extracted from the raw EEG data and classifies the two different classes. This is achieved with the help of sample entropy, approximate entropy, mean, and standard deviation of raw EEG data collected from the electrodes frontal polar, frontal, and central.

Traditional air-driven soft McKibben artificial muscles are linear actuators, and it is impossible for them to realize bending motions through use of a single muscle. More than two McKibben muscles are normally used to achieve bending or rotational motions, leading to heavier and larger systems. In addition, air-driven McKibben muscles are highly nonlinear in nature, making them difficult to be controlled precisely. An shape memory alloy (SMA)-fishing-line-McKibben (SFLM) bending actuator has been developed. This novel artificial actuator, made of an SMA-fishing-line muscle and a McKibben muscle, was able to produce the maximum output force of 3.0 N and the maximum bending angle (the rotation of the end face) of 61°. This may promote the application of individual McKibben muscles or SMA-fishing-line muscles alone. An output force control method for the SFLM is proposed, and based on MATLAB/Simulink software, an experiment platform is set up and the effectiveness of control system is verified through output force experiments. A three-fingered SFLM gripper driven by three SFLMs has been designed for a case study and for which the maximum carrying capacity is 650.4 ± 0.2 g.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2830314","National High Technology Research, Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2015AA042302); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61573093); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:N150308001); Equipment Pre-Research Program of China(grant numbers:62501040412); EPSRC Fellowship Project (Soft robotic technologies for next-generation bio-integrative medical devices)(grant numbers:EP/M020460/1,EP/M026388/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8351924","Expansive McKibben muscle;fishing line;SMA-fishing-line;SMA-fishing-line-McKibben actuator;force control","Actuators;Muscles;Force;Robots;Bars;Wires","","26","","32","OAPA","27 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The BDS conductivity scales linearly with the Fermi level that can be tuned by bias application, enhancing the electromagnetic-field concentration and shrinking the effective current path, thereby blue-shifting the operating frequency within an ultrawideband.

Firstly, the new motor topology and structural characteristics are briefly presented. Secondly, the d- and q-axis for the FT-FSPM motor are defined, which is crucial to the mathematical model and control scheme, and the mathematical models are derived. Then, two control schemes, i.e., FOC and DTC, and the main system are proposed. The operational principles of the two control schemes are presented, and space vector pulse width modulation(SVPWM) based on four neighboring vectors is adopted to reduce current harmonics and torque ripples. Finally, the simulated and experimental results are given, and performance analysis of the two control schemes are compared and discussed. The results reveal that FOC scheme has the sinusoidal phase current and low torque ripples, while the DTC scheme has fast dynamic response, verifying the effectiveness of the two proposed control schemes.

Ultrasonic transducers in the frequency range of 20-100 MHz are, therefore, not well developed because of less application into ultrasonic imaging or suitable piezoelectric materials with this frequency range. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) is usually used for ultrasonic transducers in the 10-50-MHz ranges. However, their electromechanical coupling coefficient k2t of 4% is not enough for the practical uses. In order to excite the ultrasonic wave in the 20-100 MHz range, a 125-25-μm-thick piezoelectric film is required when the longitudinal velocity of the material is assumed to be 5000 m/s. However, it is difficult to grow such a thick piezoelectric film without a crack being caused by the internal stress during the dry deposition technique. We achieved a stress-free film growth by employing the unique hot target sputtering technique without heating the substrate. High-efficient 81(k2t = 18.5%) and 43-MHz (k2t = 15.2%) ultrasonic generation by using the 43and 90-μm extremely thick ScAlN (Sc: 39%) films were demonstrated, respectively.

This paper proposes an optimal model to determine the belief reliability distribution based on the maximum entropy principle when kth moments of what can be obtained. An estimation method using linear interpolation and a genetic algorithm is subsequently applied to the optimal model. When only the expected value and the variance are available, the optimal results are in accordance with the maximum entropy principle. It could be observed in the sensitivity analysis that the accuracy of the optimal results is a decreasing function of the width of variances and an increasing function of the number of interpolation points. Therefore, researchers could adapt to different widths of variances and requirements of accuracy by adjusting the number of interpolation points.

To address this problem, this paper presents a coordinated control method of distributed energy storage systems (DESSs) for voltage regulation in a distribution network. The influence of the voltage caused by the PV plant is analyzed in a simple distribution feeder at first. The voltage regulation areas corresponding to DESSs are divided by calculating and comparing the voltage sensitivity matrix. Then, a coordinated voltage control strategy is proposed for the DESSs. Finally, the simulation results of the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution network verify the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control method.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-018-0077-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368134","Distributed energy storage;Voltage regulation;Voltage sensitivity;Coordinated control;Photovoltaic (PV) plants","Photovoltaic systems;Reactive power;Sensitivity;Simulation;Distribution networks;Medium voltage;Discharges (electric)","","23","","19","","21 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

When the principles, requirements, influencing factors and goals of military material support forces are deployed in wartime, an evaluation indicator system is established. Thus, a new combined empowerment method based on an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is developed to calculate the subjective weights, and the rough entropy method is used to calculate the objective weights. Combination weights can be obtained by calculating the weight preference coefficient error, which is determined by combining the cooperative game method and the minimum deviation into objectives. This approach can determine the grey relation projection coefficient and synthesize the measure scheme superiority to finally optimize the deployment plan using the grey relation projection decision-making method. The results show that the method is feasible and effective; it can provide a more scientific and practical decision-making basis for the military material support power deployment in wartime.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.04.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456482","method for grey relation projection decision-making;military supply power in war;deployment plan;optimization;analytic hierarchy process (AHP);rough entropy method","Decision making;Entropy;Force;Optimization;Analytical models","","22","","","","6 Sep 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

LEACH protocol uses certain approximations and assumptions. In this paper, we tried to find what happens if these basic assumptions and approximations of LEACH are not considered. We have found that EelecRx plays a vital role in deciding optimum number of clusters and EelecTx has no effect on number of clusters in the network.

However, the existing VLP algorithm based on image sensors often fails to achieve a good positioning effect when the camera is tilted. In order to solve this problem, we propose a neural network algorithm to correct the error caused by the tilt angle of the camera. Because when the tilt angle is different, the LED image captured by the camera will be different and produce different characteristics. By extracting these features and using neural networks to establish the relationship between the characteristics of the LED image and the distance between the receiving and sending terminal, we finally achieve the positioning of the camera by the triangulation algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our positioning algorithm can achieve high-precision positioning and can be applied to most indoor positioning systems.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2880872","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371176); Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou China(grant numbers:201704020137,201707010485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532113","Neural network algorithm;tilt angle;visible light positioning","Light emitting diodes;Cameras;Feature extraction;Image sensors;Neural networks;Machine learning;Sensors","","22","","13","OAPA","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The LPFG is fabricated by periodically collapsing a piece of DSHF with automatic arc discharge technology. The existence of the two air holes in the DSHF makes the cladding modes, regardless of the polarization state, concentrate in the area perpendicular to the connection of the two holes. Such a feature leads to quite different bending responses at the directions perpendicular and parallel to the connection of the air holes, which makes the DSHF-based LPFG suitable for two-axis bending measurement. The bending sensitivity of the LPFG are 21.03 nm/m-1 and 15.77 dB/m-1 at the orthogonal directions, respectively. Besides, compared with the general arc-induced LPFGs in solid fibers, the size of the DSHF-based LPFG is effectively reduced because the periodic air hole collapse in the DSHF causes a large geometric deformation of the fiber core and increases coupling coefficient between the core and cladding modes. The sensing characteristics of strain, polarization, surrounding refractive index, and temperature are also investigated in our experiment.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2781733","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61275087,11204047,61290311,61377091); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017IVA082); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8171724","Two-axis bending;dual side hole;long period fiber grating;arc discharge technology.","Optical fiber sensors;Optical fiber polarization;Robot sensing systems;Fiber gratings;Temperature measurement","","22","","27","OAPA","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast, by directly solving self-heating equations, the internal node is eliminated in the circuit Jacobian matrix. The resulting simulation time can be shortened in principle up to 60% or more without sacrificing the accuracy. The accuracy and time for self-heating simulations formulated using different approaches are compared in this paper to study their tradeoff.

Stacking faults (SFs) are expanded from basal plane defects by using a body diode. Although it is well known that ON-voltage degradation occurs due to SFs, their effects on dynamic reliability have not been studied well. Furthermore, including the effects of SFs, there are not many reports about the dynamic reliability of SiC-MOSFETs. In this paper, a double-pulse switching test using 3.3-kV SiC-MOSFETs was carried out to clarify the failure mechanism of the switching operation of SiC-MOSFETs and effects of SFs on the safe operation area (SOA). Before the switching test, current stress was applied to the body diode of the devices under test (DUTs) to expand the SFs. The circuit configuration was half-bridge type, and a double-pulse gate signal was applied to the lower arm DUT. The switching voltage was 1.8 kV, and the switching current increased at about 8-A steps to failure. As a result, reverse recovery SOA (RRSOA) reliability decreased depending on the amount of SFs in the SiC-MOSFET. Because RRSOA failure was caused by avalanche due to the hole concentration during reverse recovery and the SFs raised local current density, reverse bias SOA (RBSOA) hardly decreased even if SFs containing SiC-MOSFETs were used. This is because RBSOA failure was caused by degradation of the gate isolation layer due to overheating and the temperature coefficient of the SFs electric resistance indicated negative.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2018.2864305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445692","Body diode;safe operation area (SOA);SiC-MOSFET;stacking fault (SF)","Degradation;Switches;Logic gates;Current density;Reliability;Electrodes;Temperature dependence","","21","","22","OAPA","24 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Predictive maintenance of the motors is of crucial importance due to the fact that unexpected faults in those machines can lead to huge economic losses for the corresponding companies. Over recent years, there is an increasing use of industrial induction motors operated by different types of drives, which have different functionalities. Among them, the use of soft-starters has proliferated due to the inherent benefits provided by these drives: they damp the high starting currents, enabling the soft startup of the motors and avoiding undesirable commutation transients introduced by other starting modalities. In spite of these advantages, they do not avoid the possible occurrence of rotor damages, one of the most common faults in this type of motors. Few works have proposed predictive maintenance techniques that are aimed to diagnose the rotor condition in soft-started machines and even fewer have demonstrated the validity of their methods in real motors. This work presents, for the first time, the massive validation of a rotor fault diagnosis methodology in soft-started induction motors. Industrial and laboratory and induction motors started under different types of soft-starters and with diverse rotor fault conditions are considered in the work.

Moreover, the comparisons between the PTBM and CTBM are given analytically by their response speed, power &energy capacity and the cost of control, which will be helpful to guide the associated operators to choose the appropriate models to take part in demand response. Considering that the wind generation fluctuates frequently and greatly, the PTBM is chosen to take part of the demand response for output optimizing of the wind generation.

We reveal that reducing the offset at the connection of few-mode fibers (FMFs) at butt coupling does not necessarily result in a minimum MDL, and the FMFs should be aligned so as to minimize the MDL, by experimentally investigating the MDL as a function of the lateral offset at butt coupling. We develop a precise rotational alignment mechanism to accurately adjust the core position without any complex alignment equipment, and we introduce a hexagonal microhole into a ferrule to accurately arrange the fibers. With these technologies, we successfully suppress the mode-dependent loss of the FI/FO device.

Ultra-short baseline (USBL) is an important technical method for performing underwater positioning and tracking of manned submersibles and ensuring the safety of their underwater operations. Using USBL, the mothership can obtain the manned submersible's position in real time. Furthermore, the manned submersible can obtain its own position at longer time intervals using digital underwater acoustic communication to assist the pilot in driving. Long baseline (LBL) is a significant supplement to USBL because it is an independent positioning system that provides more accurate and real-time navigation and positioning data for manned submersibles in large areas and deep seas. In this paper, we analyzed USBL sea-trial calibration, its application in real diving, and details of LBL sea-trial using the Jiaolong deep-sea manned submersible as a case study. Data measured during 10 consecutive dives of the Jiaolong manned submersible are utilized to analyze the USBL positioning performance. We found that the positioning performance (relative slant range error, relative depth error, and data efficiency) is consistent with calibration results. Finally, a rectangular path with a length of 900 m and breadth of 300 mis designed to verify LBL performance in deep sea. The LBL sea-trial results show that the positioning accuracy of LBL is better than that of USBL. The USBL positioning performance is affected by the distance from the mothership and its heading.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2881390","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0305700); Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology(grant numbers:QNLM2016ORP0406); Taishan Scholar Project Funding(grant numbers:TSPD20161007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41641049); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2015EM005); Shandong Provincial Key R&D Program(grant numbers:2016GSF115006); Qingdao Independent Innovation Project(grant numbers:15-9-1-90-JCH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540458","Ultra-short baseline;long baseline;manned submersible;sea trial;calibration","Underwater vehicles;Calibration;Transducers;Position measurement;Oceans;Acoustics;Sea measurements","","18","","5","OAPA","19 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that the slow light structures with medium slow down factors (specifically slowdown factors of less than 6) can be reasonable candidates for enhancing the modulator's energy efficiency.

It is a key issue in the sailing performance and navigation cost of unmanned vessels. The merchant ship trajectory and attitude are always generated from the response mechanism for ship motion, which uses one rudder and one propeller as the actuator. Therefore, it is a typical underactuated ship. However, there is not a specialized control test platform for unmanned merchant ships, in particular container ships. A precise merchant ship motion control platform is crucial; its computing power and motion attitude monitoring are difficult to solve by shipborne computers. To solve this problem, a new free-running ship motion control platform is proposed, which realizes ship attitude monitoring and various motion control experiments. The proposed platform is novel as it embeds ship motion parameters and control parameters in the ship motion model, which successfully solves the precise control of the ship motion control experiment with linear or nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, the design scheme of the ship motion control platform is first presented. Then, the operating principle of the platform is shown, and the adaptive model of the ship plane motion is selected.

Apart from it being very difficult for an attacker to add a trigger into the original design before making an attack or to control the encryption device, there is a big gap in the capacity of existing SCAs to pose real threats to cipher devices. In this paper, we propose a new method, the sliding window SCA (SW-SCA), which can be applied in scenarios in which the acquisition device is independent of the encryption device and for which the encryption source code requires no trigger signal or modification. First, we describe the main issues in existing SCAs, then we theoretically analyze the effectiveness and complexity of our proposed SW-SCA -a method that can incorporate a sliding-window mechanism into almost all of the existing non-profiled SCAs.

When the width of one of the pillar (say n-pillar) is modified, the doping concentration (say donor) should be changed to maintain a charge balance condition. This in turn, changes the width of the depletion region, due to the parasitic JFET effect and as a result the effective on-state conduction path. This raises the question whether the best tradeoff between the specific on-state resistance and the breakdown voltage could be achieved by employing the conventional assumption of the same width of the n and p pillars. This paper clarifies the best option for the width of each pillar when designing a superjunction MOSFET and adapts the figures of merit to take into account the asymmetrical superjunction cell.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2018.2839180","On Semiconductor Corporation as a part of a future power electronics technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369343","JFET;power MOSFET;superjunction","JFETs;MOSFET;Resistance;Doping;Semiconductor device modeling;Technological innovation;Mathematical model","","17","","15","OAPA","30 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For radiation, each element is excited and fed with 90° phase shift between adjacent ones to perform broadband circular-polarized operation. For scattering, destructive phase difference is created in an ultra-wide band for orthogonally polarized incidence due to the anisotropic structure.

In this paper, a ROS-based in-band OSNR monitoring method is proposed for erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) amplified multispan dense wavelength division multiplexing systems with cascaded filtering effect (CFE) caused by cascaded add-drop filters or wavelength selective switches. In such systems, the optical signal as well as the optical noise may experience significant CFE making the ROS-based methods proposed before ineffective. The new method solves this problem and performs very well for OSNR in the range of 10-30 dB when the fiber nonlinear effect and nonideal filtering effect are present. The OSNR monitor based on the new method is also more convenient to use as only one-time calibration is required when used at different monitoring locations along the optical link.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2824353","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61475053); Major Equipment Development Project of China(grant numbers:2013YQ160487); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8333701","Optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR);optical performance monitoring (OPM);optical spectrum (OS);cascaded filtering effect (CFE)","Optical noise;Signal to noise ratio;Monitoring;Optical transmitters;Optical polarization;Nonlinear optics;Optical receivers","","16","","17","OAPA","9 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, based on the extinction theorem, the dependent relationship between the equivalent surface electric and magnetic currents are proposed, and it is observed that the non-physical modes do not obey the dependent relationship, whereas the physical modes are governed by the dependent relationship. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lack of the dependent relationship causes the non-physical modes.

To tackle the above problems of the SVM model, the algorithm proposed in this paper is optimized from three aspects. Firstly, the gray area of the SVM model is judged by the probability output and the corresponding samples are processed. Therefore the clustering of the samples in the gray area is improved. The problem of low accuracy in the training of the SVM model in the gray area is improved, while the size of the sample is reduced and the efficiency is improved. Finally, by adjusting the model of the penalty factor in the SVM model after the clustering of the samples, the number of samples with unstable states being misjudged as stable is reduced.

On the other hand, while a nonlinear model can be used to capture the dynamics of energy harvesting circuits, it introduces additional complexity at the optimization stage. Specifically, under a nonlinear model, traditional convex optimization is not applicable, since the energy harvesting function is fractional. To address this challenge, this letter first derives an optimal solution for static channels by introducing pseudo-inverse of the nonlinear model.

The opposite VTH shift was achieved by applying atomic-layer deposited Al2O3 passivation layer.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2868905","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1C1B5017470); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454756","β-Ga₂O₃;bias stress;stability","Stress;Temperature measurement;Field effect transistors;Temperature;Semiconductor device measurement;Iron;Performance evaluation","","16","","26","OAPA","5 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in current IMWP devices, there are some challenges that need to be overcome. These include the ~1 GHz frequency resolution of the IMWP functionalities, limited by the on-chip photonic functional devices' performance, which has prompted research into on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) to achieve sub-30 MHz signal processing capabilities. Equally important, the performance metrics including the noise figure, dynamic range, and the insertion loss, need to be improved before commercial deployment. While SBS offers significant advantages of high resolution and reconfigurability, there is potential for improved signal-to-noise ratios and, therefore, to obtain a low noise figure.

To describe such a phenomenon in degradations, a multi-degradation model with public noise is proposed. To identify the degradation states and the unknown parameters, an iterative estimation method is proposed by using the Kalman filter and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Next, with known thresholds, the RUL of each degradation can be predicted by using the first hitting time (FHT). In addition, the RUL of the whole system can be obtained by a Copula function.

PIN diodes mounted on the printed circuit boards are embedded into a coaxial filter to enable ON and OFF states. In the ON-state, the PIN diodes are turned OFF, which do not introduce the loss and affect the linearity. Two transmission zeros are generated by a novel feeding structure, which improves the skirt selectivity. In the OFF-state, the PIN diodes are turned on. Then, lumped capacitors are loaded to the coaxial resonators so that the resonant frequencies of the resonators are changed. The passband at the operating frequency cannot be formed, resulting in high isolation. For demonstration, the coaxial-resonator-based filtering switch is designed and fabricated. Good agreement between simulated and measured results verifies the proposed ideas. Comparison with other reported filtering switches is given.

VLC combines the advantages of lighting and communication simultaneously. Besides, it can be deployed using existing lighting infrastructure; hence little extra cost is needed to provide this wireless communication. As the OPD has a large optical detection area, it would be interesting to employ the OPD as VLC receiver (Rx). If the OPD can be used in the VLC systems, it can benefit the Internet-of-Thing (IoT) networks by providing efficient human-to-machine and machine-to-machine communications. However, implementing VLC using OPD Rx is challenging. Due to the slow charging and discharging processes of the OPD, the optical-to-electrical response speed is limited. Besides, the OPD requires external bias to be operated. Here, we propose and demonstrate using pre-distortion scheme for pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) signal to a self-powered PCBM:P3HT OPD to enhance the VLC transmission performance. The operation of the self-powered PCBM:P3HT OPD is discussed. Both experiments using PAM-2 and PAM-4 (with and without pre-distortion) are evaluated.

The challenge is to secure zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on for all switches within the full-power range. In this paper a novel VSF single-dual-phase-shift(SDPS) control strategy is proposed, which consists of three control freedoms, i.e., two phase shifts and one variable switching frequency to secure ZVS and achieve PFC simultaneously. ZVS boundaries are pictured and compared among single-phase-shift(SPS), dual-phase-shift(DPS) and the proposed single-dual-phase-shift(SDPS) control.

Structural dispersion induces an extremely high cell leakage current, which determines aspects of DRAM performance such as refresh time (tREF). However, no method is currently available for evaluating variations, which is a serious problem in developing DRAM. Although the average leakage current from a test element group has been used as an index for determining cell leakage, it does not provide the distribution of unit cell leakage current. We find that cell leakage distribution can be calculated from the slope of the retention time-fail bit plot (defined as TF slope). A steep slope indicates a narrow cell leakage distribution, which corresponds to a narrower structural distribution, and therefore a long tREF. Using statistical models and experiments based on extensive data, our results confirm this relationship. Another impact and contribution of TF slope are that the development period can be saved because a wrong decision (which process is better) can be avoided. This method is used successfully as an indicator to estimate selected processes and to facilitate DRAM development.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2758026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067456","DRAM;cell transistor;leakage current distribution;gate-induced drain leakage current (GIDL);process variation;refresh time;time-fail bit plot (TF slope);retention time","Leakage currents;Random access memory;Current measurement;Transistors;Logic gates;Indexes","","14","","8","OAPA","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the channel noise is Poisson distributed, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection is mathematically intractable for DCO-OFDM, and the ML-detection-based minimum distance criterion originally for Gaussian channels is applied to SPAD-based DCO-OFDM. However, the error performance is degraded. For this reason, we propose an Anscombe root (AR) DCO-OFDM by using the existing AR transformation before fast Fourier transformation at the receiver side and a square operation at the transmitter. For the proposed AR-DCO-OFDM, the channel noise is well approximated to be Gaussian distributed, and thus, the asymptotically optimal detection is based on the low-complexity minimum-distance criterion. Extensive simulations indicate that our proposed AR-DCO-OFDM can substantially improve the conventional DCO-OFDM with minimum-distance detection for SPAD-based VLC systems, and the attained gain is above 5 dB at the bit error rate of 10-4 for numerous scenarios.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2785798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267485","Visible light communication;OFDM;single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs);Anscombe root transformation and maximum likelihood","OFDM;Optical transmitters;Photonics;Optical receivers;Adaptive optics;High-speed optical techniques;Light emitting diodes","","14","","22","OAPA","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a range walk error (RWE) exists in Gm-APDs which refers to the fluctuation of the measured distance as a function of the intensity of echo pulses. In this paper, we present a real-time restraint method for RWE implemented by unequally intensity-dividing the echo pulses into two Gm-APDs. The difference image of two depth images measured by the divided beams is a matrix of RWE distribution and the intensity image is used to censor the anomalous pixels in the matrix. Combined with the matrix of RWE distribution, an accurate depth image with low RWE can be obtained. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces approximately 86% RWE of the conventional method in real time.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2816652","Seventh Six-talent Peak project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2014-DZXX-007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271332); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30920140112012); Innovation Fund Project for Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Systems for High-Dimensional Information of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:JYC01509); Fund Project for Low-light-level Night Vision Laboratory(grant numbers:J20130501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318616","Lidar;photon counting;three-dimensional imaging;range walk error","Laser beams;Lasers;Laser radar;Imaging;Real-time systems;Photonics;Reflectivity","","14","","25","OAPA","16 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is so-called self-mixing effect (SME). An SME-based displacement sensor is featured with compact physical setup and interferometric measurement resolution. However, when a target has a surface with very low reflectivity, the sensing signal is very weak and noisy. The system may even lose its sensing capability. It is desired to develop a method for improving the sensing performance in this case. We propose a configuration of dual external cavities for the SME-based sensing system, where one of the cavities is used to provide prefeedback for improving the sensing sensitivity and the other is related to the target to be measured. First, a sensing model is derived for the proposed configuration and shows that the magnitude of the sensing signal can be enhanced by setting the prefeedback cavity with suitable location and high optical feedback strength. Then, experimental investigations are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. This paper provides an important guidance for designing an SME-based sensor with high sensitivity.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2876117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8492431","Displacement sensor;laser sensing;measurement sensitivity;optical feedback interferometry;self-mixing interferometry","Sensors;Cavity resonators;Sensitivity;Mathematical model;Measurement by laser beam;Displacement measurement;Reflectivity","","14","","17","OAPA","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Ge 3d spectra in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy are also compared among the Al2O3, Y2O3, HfO2, and La2O3 on GeOx/Ge structures. It is found that Al2O3 provides the lowest slow trap density for both electrons and holes in comparison with Y2O3, HfO2, and La2O3 high-k films, while similar Dit values are observed among the MOS interfaces with Al2O3, Y2O3, HfO2, and La2O3. The additional slow traps in the MOS capacitors with Y2O3, HfO2, and La2O3 are attributable to any defects in the high-k films and/or the interfaces with GeOx.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2822758","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:17H06148); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology(grant numbers:JPMJCR1332); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330012","Slow trap density;Ge;MOS interfaces;plasma oxidation;ALD high-k films","Hafnium compounds;Aluminum oxide;Plasmas;High-k dielectric materials;Films;Logic gates;Electron traps","","13","","34","OAPA","3 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Temperature rise is also a nonnegligible factor that can significantly influence the performances of oil-paper insulation. This paper aims to reveal the effects of ambient temperature and superimposed voltage on surface charge and flashover behaviors in an oil-paper insulation system. Surface potential decay (SPD) experiments were performed under superimposed voltage with various polarity and amplitude combinations and at the temperature ranging from 20 °C to 80 °C. The results show that the initial surface potential and decay rate increase as the amplitude of the impulse voltage increases at 20 °C. The initial surface potential declines, and the process of SPD is accelerated at higher temperatures because of the increased concentration of shallow traps. Subsequently, flashover tests were conducted under superimposed voltage. It is found that flashover occurs after applying superimposed voltages even with a rather low dc voltage. In addition, the dc voltage component is primarily responsible for flashover. Weibull results also indicate that it is prone to trigger flashover at higher temperatures, because thermal excitation helps more carriers to escape from deep traps and participate in the process of flashover. Accordingly, the insulation characteristics of oil-paper system can be significantly influenced by superimposed voltage and temperature, which should draw great concern among the power grid.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877476","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807136,51537008); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX201700168); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M621070); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(grant numbers:18JCQNJC07300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502024","Oil-paper insulation;impulse with superimposed dc voltage;temperature rise;surface charge;trap distribution;flashover","Electric potential;Flashover;Surface treatment;Temperature measurement;Temperature;Insulation;Surface discharges","","13","","24","OAPA","21 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are different filters used in the power system. Passive filters provide limited compensation, so active filters can be used for variable compensation. In this paper, a shunt active filter has been made adaptive using a Variable Leaky Least Mean Square (VLLMS) based controller. Proposed adaptive controller can be able to compensate for harmonic currents, power factor and nonlinear load unbalance.

This implementation enables the inverter developers to evaluate the FPGA-based high-speed controller in the early process by a real-time simulator system, which is unable for offline commercial simulation software packages. The discrete-time models, which are implementable on FPGA, are derived by discretizing the continuous-time models of the inverter using the forward-difference method.

The mean intrastroke velocity variation (averaged over one 50-m lap) in freestyle swimming was less than 0.6% in all cases. This resulted in a timing under-estimate of less than 0.60 ms for freestyle, 4.0 ms for breaststroke, and a timing overestimate of less than 6.2 ms for backstroke. The difference was less than 5% over the complete stroke (one way ANOVA p > 0.05), indicating no significant difference in the velocity profiles.

However, it is newly validated by numerical simulations that for some specified initial states, such a buck converter with the same circuit parameters can operate in a chaotic oscillation state as well, reflecting the existence of bi-stable oscillation states. Based on the piecewise continuous model of COT controlled buck converter, the bi-stability phenomenon associated with two sets of initial states is revealed by numerical simulations and verified by PSIM circuit simulations.

When using magnetic field sensors to measure magnetic field gradient as the coefficients of tensor, field differentiation is generally approximated by field difference. As a result, magnetic objects positioning by magnetic field gradient tensor measurement always involves an inherent error caused by sensor sizes, leading to a reduction in detectable distance and detectable angle. In this paper, the inherent positioning error caused by magnetic field gradient tensor measurement is calculated and corrected by iterations based on the systematic position error distribution patterns. The results show that, the detectable distance range and the angle range of an ac magnetic object (2.44 Am2 @1 kHz) can be increased from (0.45 m, 0.75 m), (0°, 25°) to (0.30 m, 0.80 m), (0°, 80°), respectively.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.03.02","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406342","magnetic dipole;magnetic gradient tensor;positioning error;error correction","Tensile stress;Position measurement;Magnetic sensors;Measurement uncertainty;Measurement errors;Noise measurement","","13","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The global MPP cannot always be achieved by the conventional MPPT methods. Therefore a novel MPPT method for PV systems using flower pollination (FP) algorithm is proposed in this paper and the Levy flight is used to improve the convergence of FP algorithm. MPPT model of the PV system is established in MATLAB to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the proposed method is compared with two well established MPPT methods.

A time division driving method is utilized to prevent the crosstalk of display signals into touch circuits, and two pre-charging nodes are employed to relieve the uniformity degradation of output signals caused by different stresses on pull-up TFTs. The proposed circuit activates a drain of the first pre-charging TFT only at display scanning periods, which reduces coupling noises and power consumption. In addition, an internal inverter is turned off for touch sensing operations, resulting in a wide range of threshold voltage shift compensation and low power consumption. SPICE simulation results with a low temperature poly silicon TFT model show that the proposed circuit compensates for the threshold voltage shift up to 17 V. In a 60 Hz full-HD display with a 120 Hz touch reporting rate, the noise level of the first pre-charging node is -16.78 dB in between 2.37 and -28.95 dB of two previous circuits, and the total power consumption for 160 stages is substantially reduced to 4.44 mW compared to previous approaches.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2813526","IDEC (EDA Tool); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1A2B4009787); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8310025","Low power;low noise;shift register;in-cell touch;TFT","Shift registers;Sensors;Thin film transistors;Power demand;Inverters;Integrated circuit modeling;Couplings","","12","","16","OAPA","8 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, these surface properties are modified with varying the duration of oxygen plasma treatments on the SiNx surface, eluding to a different surface roughness and energy. From our analysis coupled with the experimental results, it is found that the surface roughness (Ra) controls the degree of surface roughness scattering (χSR) while the surface energy (ES) determines the reference mobility (μb), yielding the effective hole mobility expressed as a product of two terms associated with μb and χSR, respectively. It is found that μb follows a power law as a function of ES, and χSR grows exponentially with increasing Ra.

Load sharing among inverters in distributed generators (DGs) is a key issue. This study investigates the feasibility of power-sharing among parallel DGs using a dual control strategy in islanded mode of a microgrid. PQ control and droop control techniques are established to control the microgrid operation. P-f and Q-E droop control is used to attain real and reactive power sharing. The frequency variation caused by load change is an issue in droop control strategy whereas the tracking error of inverter power in PQ control is also a challenge. To address these issues, two DGs are interfaced with two parallel inverters in an islanded AC microgrid. PQ control is investigated for controlling the output real and reactive power of the DGs by assigning their references. The inverter under enhanced droop control implements power reallocation to restore the frequency among the distributed generators with predefined droop characteristics. A dual control strategy is proposed for the AC microgrid under islanded operation without communication link. Simulation studies are carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK and the results show the validity and effective power-sharing performance of the system while maintaining a stable operation when the microgrid is in islanding mode.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-018-0084-2","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51477098); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0900504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368148","Microgrid;Inverter parallel operation control strategy;Droop control strategy;Frequency restore;Power sharing","Reactive power;Simulation;Microgrids;Power system stability;Inverters;Generators;Stability analysis","","11","","15","","21 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

Contrary to the nearly normal distribution of the RDD-induced ON-current variations in conventional CMOS transistors, the TFET’s ON-currents variations are described by a logarithmic distribution. The distributions of other figures of merit (FoM) such as threshold voltage and subthreshold swing are also reported. The variability in the FoM is analyzed by studying the correlation between the number and the position of the dopants.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2018.2859586","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P009972/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8419746","Randomly discrete dopants;variability;Si-InAs nanowire FETs;NEGF;quantum transport","TFETs;Probability density function;Silicon;Ions;Tunneling;Statistical analysis","","11","","15","CCBY","25 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complex quality factor ( $Q_{\textrm {sc}}$ )-peak frequency of the BPF is chosen as the half final output frequency to further improve the phase noise performance. Also, the improvement of the odd harmonic suppression and even harmonic enhancement can be easily obtained. Moreover, due to the existence of the common mode suppression, only 180° out-of-phase mode will be achieved which makes the oscillator run in a stable condition. To validate the design concept, a push–push oscillator based on a microstrip differential BPF has been achieved which is operating at 8.37 GHz.

A consensus algorithm with pinning node is employed to allocate power among BESUs in the secondary control whereas in the primary control, the local controller of BESU adjusts output power according to the reference power from secondary control. Part of BESUs are selected to be pinning node for accepting command from dispatching center while other BESUs as following nodes which exchange output power and SoC information with the adjacent nodes through communication network. After calculating reference power of each BESU by adopting consensus algorithm, the power sharing in DBESS is achieved according to their respective SoC of BESUs.

A two-stage approach that integrates optimal island partition and power dispatch is proposed in this paper, considering photovoltaics (PVs), batteries (BEs) and electric vehicles (EVs) as the power sources. In the first stage, energy indices are defined to describe the energy demand and the maximum energy that these distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide, and islands are partitioned based on an energy constraint. Considering the variability the loads and PVs, the energy constraint is a necessary but not sufficient condition for island operation, so in the second stage, a power dispatch model is proposed as a test for the island partition result. Sequential power flow is also simulated to guarantee a feasible and optimized island status. The situations when the tests are not passed are analyzed and classified, and corresponding modifications for the first stage model are provided. Multiple levels of constraints based on the energy index are established for the island partition model. The proposed approach has been validated through simulation using a modified IEEE 69-bus system which is divided into three districts with different load variability characteristics.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0314-z","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8894236","Optimal island partition;Distributed generation;Island power dispatch;Active distribution networks;Photovoltaic;Electric vehicles","Load modeling;Indexes;Power supplies;Security;Partitioning algorithms;Batteries;Electric vehicles","","11","","","","7 Nov 2019","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The outer-independent total domination number of a graph G, denoted by γoit(G), is the minimum cardinality of an OITDS of G. An outer-independent total Roman dominating function (OITRDF) on a graph G is a function f : V(G) → {0, 1, 2} satisfying the conditions that every vertex u with f (u) = 0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v with f (v) = 2, every vertex x with f (x) ≥ 1 is adjacent to at least one vertex y with f (y) ≥ 1, and any two different vertices a, b with f (a) = f (b) = 0 are not adjacent.

Due to the high di/dt and dv/dt of the MOSFET and parasitic parameters in the circuit, drain voltage spikes and oscillations will be generated during turn-off, which can affect the safety of the device and degrade the system's electromagnetic compatibility. This paper first studies the relationship between drain voltage spike and gate voltage during turn-off. Based on the effect of gate voltage on drain voltage spike, a new active gate driver that optimizes gate voltage is proposed. The proposed active gate driver detects the slope of the drain voltage and generates a positive pulse in the drain current fall phase to increase the gate voltage, thereby suppressing drain voltage spike and oscillation. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed active gate driver, a simulation circuit and an experimental platform are constructed and compared with the conventional gate driver. Simulation and experimental results show that the new active gate driver can effectively suppress the drain voltage spike and oscillation of MOSFETs, and can effectively reduce high-frequency EMI.","2075-5597","","10.23919/CJEE.2018.8409349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409349","Active gate driver;electromagnetic interference;voltage spike;oscillation","Oscillators;Logic gates;MOSFET;Inductance;Threshold voltage;Integrated circuit modeling;Switches","","10","","","","12 Jul 2018","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

Therefore, it can be regarded as the multi-input one-output system that is the same as an elementary perceptron in the pattern recognition system. In analogy with the actual neurons whose coupling strength varies on a moment-to-moment basis, a flexible control of the weight for each individual input signal is required in order to realize the correct recognition. The analog change of the resistance values observed in the resistance change device is quite suitable for such application. In this contribution, we successfully demonstrate the high-speed analog resistance change in the TiN/TaOx/Ta2O5/TiN resistive analog neuromorphic device (RAND). An introduction of the TiN electrode smoothed the discontinuity in both the resistance switching processes by dc and pulse voltages. On the other hands, digital resistance switching was dominant in TiN/TaOx/Ta2O5/Pt device. We deduce that the electrodes reactivity with oxygen and the interface resistance play a key role for the analog resistance switching. The analog resistance change speed of 200 ns is much faster than the signal transmission speed between neurons and is thought to increase the number of operations per unit energy consumption. By introducing present RAND, the human-brain inspired information processor is expected to become energetically more efficient.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2875942","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8495005","Nonvolatile memory;resistive RAM (ReRAM);analog memory;neuromorphic","Resistance;Tin;Electrodes;Immune system;Synapses;Neurons;Couplings","","10","","25","OAPA","17 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is similar to the ideal TDF controller and it makes the design of the controller simpler. The discrete model of the converter is used to compute one of the two parameters, which is known as the feedback gain. The frequency domain comparison of the proposed controller and the ideal TDF controller shows that the proposed controller is almost non-invasive, because it does not change the dc component of the converter and only changes slightly the harmonic at the switching frequency. The proposed controller has another structure called the extended controller, which needs three parameters. By increasing the third parameter, the feedback gain needs a larger value to stabilize the converter. The benefit of the proposed controller lies in the fact that it does not need the digital circuit that was thought to be necessary for the TDF control of the converter.

Traditionally, the spatial sampling interval, which needs to satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion, has mostly been selected based on the worst case scenario. However, smaller spatial sampling interval will introduce more time consumption in the scanning. We have derived in theory an optimal spatial sampling criterion based on the target size and the threshold power beam width of transmitter/receiver antenna.

The proposed descriptor, namely, dense local phase quantization (DLPQ) is based on the phase responses, which is generated using the well-known LPQ descriptor. Furthermore, local dense histograms are extracted from the horizontal stripes of the phase maps followed by a pooling operation to address viewpoint changes and, finally, concatenated into an ear descriptor. Although the proposed DLPQ descriptor is built on the traditional LPQ, we particularly show that drastic improvements (of over 20%) are attained with respect to this latter descriptor on two benchmark data sets.

The traditional inertial measurement matching methods for hull deformation estimation largely depend on prior deformation information. However, the real-time deformation data characteristics are commonly different from the characteristics of historical deformation data, and a measurement matching method based on an inaccurate deformation model will result in a larger deformation estimation error. To overcome this difficulty, a hull deformation measurement method based on attitude quaternion matching and an online neural network is proposed. First, a deformation measurement equation based on quaternion matching is established with the angular velocity information measured by inertial sensors. Then, an online neural network is used to fit the deformation angle in the measurement equation to avoid establishing the deformation model. Considering the real-time training of an online neural network, the connection weight coefficients are estimated using a nonlinear filter. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate the deformation without prior information of the deformation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2807183","“Inertial Technology” Key Laboratory Foundation of the National Defense Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:61425060201162506007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293787","Inertial sensors;hull deformation;attitude quaternion;online neural network","Strain;Mathematical model;Deformable models;Quaternions;Inertial navigation;Marine vehicles;Neural networks","","9","","18","OAPA","16 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the real-time position of the SINS is approximately located, and the deviation of the gravity vector caused by the vehicle's displacement can be compensated, which further improves the alignment accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing algorithm and it can provide ideal initial conditions for the fine alignment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2812860","National key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFB0501700,2016YFB0501701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8307065","Inertial navigation;attitude control;position measurement;estimation theory","Gravity;Position measurement;Estimation;Acceleration;Vehicle dynamics;Global Positioning System","","9","","20","OAPA","6 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For machining operations in particular, the use of industrial robots becomes a cost-saving and flexible alternative compared to conventional CNC machines, which have restricted working areas that limit the produced shapes. Limited pose and path accuracy restrict the use of industrial robots in machining applications. Machining process forces may cause significant tool center point deviations and chatter due to the heavy mechanical demands. This paper proposes a methodology to predict the path deviations due to the machining process, thus allowing to achieve reasonable precision values for the workpiece.

The ground and 1/3 bias schemes are desirable for reading a row of cells and a single cell, respectively, whereas the 1/2 bias scheme is more suitable for the write operation. The RM is strongly influenced by the number of word line (WL) layers, which determines the number of half-selected cells. The WP is predominantly affected by the in-plane array size rather than the number of WL layers, as the majority of the power is consumed in the selected WL. Only slight differences between the WL plane and WL even/odd structures are observed in the RM and WP.

Specifically, we explore the potential of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a data-driven approach to decompose the temporal signal into components of different frequencies. Based on the assumption that the high-frequency components are corresponding to speckle, these effects can be isolated and removed. We assessed the speckle filtering performance of the transform using hypertemporal Sentinel-1 data acquired over central Germany comprising 53 scenes. We investigated speckle suppression, ratio images, and edge preservation. For the latter, a novel approach was developed.

The delay length of each MZDI was designed to achieve constructive and destructive interferences for the TE and TM modes simultaneously. First, we have fabricated and estimated a single-stage MZDI-type PBS. Owing to the difference of the in-phase or out-of-phase conditions between TE and TM modes in case of the designed delay length of the MZDI, the center wavelengths of the transmissivity for both the constructive and destructive interference are different for the TE and TM modes. Thus, the polarization extinction ratio (PER) was as small as 5 dB within the C-band. To improve the PER, a two-stage MZDI structure was introduced. In addition, the length of the multimode interferometer type optical splitter was determined to have an optimal splitting ratio of 50:50 for the TM mode for the shortest wavelength within the operating wavelength range. The center wavelength of the MZDIs was shifted to achieve the widest possible bandwidth with a large PER. We have fabricated the silicon photonic PBS to achieve a PER larger than 15 dB.

Thus, super-resolution techniques are possible solutions for such purpose with input low-resolution images. Sparse-coding-based superresolution methods are well known for their efficiency. However, the current sparse-coding-based methods suffer from two major problems. First, the sparse coefficient of a low-resolution patch is assumed to be same as the sparse coefficient of its corresponding high-resolution patch, which is too strict to deal with various patterns; and second, the current methods only learn one pair of high-resolution and low-resolution dictionaries, while, since patches in image are of diversity in real world, it is difficult to use only one pair of dictionaries to cover all possible patches. In this paper, to overcome these two issues, we propose a superresolution method to: 1) relax the assumption by linearizing the sparse coefficient of a low-resolution patch to that of high-resolution patch and 2) minimize super-resolution errors by jointly partitioning training patches into several clusters and learning dictionaries.

To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, the simulation of a 28 GBaud QPSK optical fiber communication system is carried, in which 76 MSa/s sampling rate is equivalent to 66.5 GSa/s sampling rate. The results show that maximum estimation error is less than 160 ps/nm after 100 km to 2300 km SSMF transmission.

The state-of-the-art approach for privacy preserving data release is differential privacy, which offers powerful privacy guarantee without confining assumptions about the background knowledge about attackers. For genomic data with huge-dimensional attributes, however, current approaches based on differential privacy are not effective to handle. Specifically, amount of noise is required to be injected to genomic data with tens of million of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), which would significantly degrade the utility of released data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a differential privacy guaranteed genomic data releasing method. Through executing belief propagation on factor graph, our method can factorize the distribution of sensitive genomic data into a set of local distributions. After injecting differential-privacy noise to these local distributions, synthetic sensitive data can be obtained by sampling on noise distribution. Synthetic sensitive data and factor graph can be further used to construct approximate distribution of non-sensitive data. Finally, non-sensitive genomic data is sampled from the approximate distribution to construct a synthetic genomic dataset.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421548","differential privacy;SNP/trait associations;belief propagation;factor graph;data releasing","Genomics;Bioinformatics;Belief propagation;Probability distribution","","9","","","","16 Aug 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Recently, the blanket jamming method based on PSS is proposed against synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, the method still remains challenging to obtain the desired jamming effect because it suffers from insufficient energy when the reflectivity of the reflector is not enough or the protected area is too large. In this paper, a target feature transformation method based on PSS is proposed to counter SAR. The method attaches the PSS material to the protected target surface and utilizes one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) random code PSS modulation to dynamically control the reflected signal. As a result, the generated target image is defocused and turned into some strip-shaped or square-shaped areas when modulated signal is received and processed by the victim radar system. The target feature is transformed greatly and cannot be detected by radar. Moreover, the shape of the generated area can be flexibly controlled by the code width and inter-pulse modulating frequency. Simulations and experimental results are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859247","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61372170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418694","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);phase-switched screen (PSS);target feature transformation;random code modulation","Jamming;Synthetic aperture radar;Frequency modulation;Radar imaging;Azimuth","","9","","16","OAPA","24 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel sliding mode controller with non-linear disturbance observer to effectively mitigate the wide changes in the frequency. A sliding mode surface based on estimated disturbance along with states is designed. A sliding mode control law is proposed to compensate disturbances including variations in renewables, load and parameters under mismatched uncertainties.

Simulation results show that this improved algorithm is easier to implement and more robust than the formal ones.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.02.02","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355924","Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter;pruning algorithm;proximity targets;clutter rate","Merging;Clutter;Target tracking;Radio frequency;Modeling;Density measurement","","8","","","","10 May 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Therefore, the effects of a multi-infeed system are expected to influence the performance and operation of the network. Extensive studies and simulations will play an important role in determining the extension of the interactions among HVDC converters and determine if such interactions cause multiple commutation failures, thus disturbing the dynamic stability of the system. The use of CCC (Capacitor Commutated Converter) HVDC systems will also be assessed and is expected to diminish the need for a strong AC network (high short circuit level) and, therefore, mitigate multi-infeed interactions.

The method can thus evaluate critical transistor parameters and help to screen out low performance wafers before the actual fabrication. To this end, we use a simple optical spectroscopy at room temperature that measures the surface photovoltage band-edge responses in the heterostructure and uses a model that takes into account the effect of the built-in electric fields on optical absorption in the layers and heterojunctions to evaluate bandgaps, band offsets, and built-in fields. The QW charge is then calculated from the built-in fields. The main advantage of the method is in its capability to provide information on all the different layers in the typical heterostructure simultaneously in a single measurement.

Therefore, many load forecasting models would incorporate calendar information. Frequently used calendar variables include hours of a day, days of a week, months of a year, and so forth. During the past several decades, a widely-used calendar in load forecasting is the Gregorian calendar from the ancient Rome, which dissects a year into 12 months based on the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The applications of alternative calendars have rarely been reported in the load forecasting literature. This paper aims at discovering better means than Gregorian calendar to categorize days of a year for load forecasting. One alternative is the solar-term calendar, which divides the days of a year into 24 terms based on the Sun's position in the zodiac. It was originally from the ancient China to guide people for their agriculture activities. This paper proposes a novel method to model the seasonal change for load forecasting by incorporating the 24 solar terms in regression analysis. The case study is conducted for the eight load zones and the system total of ISO New England. Results from both cross-validation and sliding simulation show that the forecast based on the 24 solar terms is more accurate than its counterpart based on the Gregorian calendar.","2196-5420","","10.1007/s40565-017-0374-0","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024315","24 solar terms;Calendar;Load forecasting;Multiple linear regression","Load modeling;Load forecasting;Benchmark testing;Linear regression","","8","","21","","4 Mar 2020","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

In daily applications, sufficient training samples may not be obtained and most of the gained training samples are in various illuminations and poses. Non-sufficient training samples could not effectively express various facial conditions, so the improvement of the face recognition rate under the non-sufficient training samples condition becomes a laborious mission. In our work, the facial pose pre-recognition (FPPR) model and the dual-dictionary sparse representation classification (DD-SRC) are proposed for face recognition. The FPPR model is based on the facial geometric characteristic and machine learning, dividing a testing sample into full-face and profile. Different poses in a single dictionary are influenced by each other, which leads to a low face recognition rate. The DD-SRC contains two dictionaries, full-face dictionary and profile dictionary, and is able to reduce the interference. After FPPR, the sample is processed by the DD-SRC to find the most similar one in training samples. The experimental results show the performance of the proposed algorithm on olivetti research laboratory (ORL) and face recognition technology (FERET) databases, and also reflect comparisons with SRC, linear regression classification (LRC), and two-phase test sample sparse representation (TPTSSR).","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.01.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320420","face recognition;facial pose pre-recognition (FPPR);dual-dictionary;sparse representation method;machine learning","Training;Dictionaries;Face recognition;Face;Facial features;Modeling;Geometry","","8","","","","22 Mar 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In this paper, by performing the fractional Fourier transform to multiple incoherent LFM signals, a fast and closed-form algorithm based on phase difference is proposed for 3-D source localization under a uniform circular array. First, the phase relationship among sensors' maximum outputs in fractional Fourier domain is exploited to construct indefinite equations, and then the least square method is employed to estimate the source's azimuth angle, elevation angle, and range simultaneously. Finally, comparing with current approaches, the satisfactory performance of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated, and the effectiveness for dealing with mixed far-field and near-field sources is also confirmed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2781798","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401481); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2017JJ3368); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8225628","Linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals;near field;fractional Fourier transform (FRFT);three-dimensional (3-D) parameter estimation;uniform circular array (UCA)","Sensors;Narrowband;Fourier transforms;Wideband;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation","","8","","12","OAPA","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These alloys, lattice matched to InP, showed lower excess noise than InP and InAlAs. Dark current, most probably originating from surface leakage, was observed to be lower in composition with higher Ga concentration. Avalanche gain and excess noise measurements using lasers of 543 and 633 nm wavelengths indicated that at a given electric field, the electron ionization coefficient is larger than the hole ionization coefficient. Using the 543 nm laser, low excess noise data corresponding to an effective ionization coefficient ratio of k = 0.1 in the conventional excess noise theory was measured in Al1-xGaxAs0.56Sb0.44 (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15), although pure electron injection was not achieved.

The OM5 fibers are compliant to TIA-492AAAE and the left-tilt OM4 fibers are compliant only to TIA-492AAAD and have a bandwidth peak at a wavelength longer than 850 nm. The “left-tilt” descriptor refers to the leftward leaning slope of the differential mode delay peaks. This is an indication that the peak bandwidth is at a wavelength longer than the measurement wavelength. To measure the margin to the forward error correction limit, 24 250 m channels were constructed from two links of 100 m and 150 m using either left-tilt OM4 or OM5 fiber. Error-free performance was achieved with each of the 24 OM5 channels. None of the 24 left-tilt OM4 channels achieved error-free performance. To further characterize performance, the effective modal bandwidth was measured for 6 left-tilt OM4 fibers and 12 OM5 fibers from the same spools as the fibers used in the margin measurements. The OM4 fibers all have a left tilt at 850 nm and the OM5 fibers have either a left or right tilt. Bit error ratio (BER) versus received power was then measured over 250 m of these fibers. With the OM4 fibers, the long wavelength channels limited the system performance due to low modal bandwidth at longer wavelengths despite the left tilt at 850 nm. We demonstrate the relationship between effective modal bandwidth at 953 nm and BER performance at 910 and 940 nm.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2018.2878666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514015","Multimode fiber;optical fibers;optical fiber dispersion;optical fiber testing","Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber cables;Optical fibers;Optical fiber testing;Wavelength measurement;Bandwidth;Transceivers","","8","","20","OAPA","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the total trap distribution of a device can be expressed as a linear combination of the top surface and side wall trap distributions. The results show that the minimum trap density of the top InGaAs (100) surface is smaller than that of the {110} side walls by almost an order of magnitude.

It is shown that compared with a conventional high-k dielectric MOS capacitor, a significant inversion charge boost can be achieved by an FE MOS capacitor due to a transient steep subthreshold swing (SS) driven by the free-charge-polarization mismatch. It is also shown that the observation of transient steep SS in the experiment significantly depends not only on the measurement time but also on the viscosity coefficient under Landau’s mean field theory, which in general represents the average FE time response associated with the domain nucleation and propagation. Therefore, this paper not only establishes a theoretical framework that describes the physical origin behind the inversion charge-boost in an FE MOS capacitor but also shows that the key feature of depolarization effect on an FE MOS capacitor in the steady state should be the inversion charge boost, rather than the steep SS (e.g., sub-60 mV/decade at room temperature), which cannot be experimentally observed as the measurement time is much longer than the intrinsic FE response. Finally, from the effect of viscosity coefficient on inversion charge boost, we outline the required material targets for the FE response in field-effect transistors to be applicable for next-generation high-speed and low-power digital switches.","2329-9231","","10.1109/JXCDC.2018.2846202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379543","Ferroelectric (FE) transistor;negative capacitance;polarization","Iron;Transient analysis;MOS capacitors;High-k dielectric materials;Capacitors;Steady-state;Transistors;Temperature measurement;Dielectrics;Ferroelectric devices","","7","","22","OAPA","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The piezoelectric actuator can realize linear stepper motion by designing the sequences of the bending motions of the two transducers.

However, when the barrier layer changes from InGaN to AlGaN, both threshold current and slope efficiency deteriorate seriously. Except for the increase of the optical absorption loss resulting from the leakage of the optical field, a large leakage of carriers due to the increased piezoelectric polarization field in InGaN/AlGaN MQW region may also be responsible for this deterioration.

Size-dependent sorting of nanoparticles originates from the size-dependent distribution of trapping potential wells, which determines whether a nanoparticle can jump back and forth between parallel waveguides in weakly coupling condition. In numerical modeling, we find that it is easier for larger ones to transfer and the size threshold is power ratio dependent. By setting a thermal tuning ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometer ahead, we can adjust effectively the input power ratio of the parallel waveguides as well as the potential well distribution across them, working as a thermal tuning reconfigurable sorting unit. Consequently, a tree cascaded unit with different thresholds is also presented to be a reconfigurable multilevel sorting unit.

Most of the researches only take an invariable controller which functions through the whole stage into consideration, the situation in which controller changes over time is rarely taken into account. However, there are limitations for invariable controller dominated algorithms in practical situation, which makes them unable to meet changing environment. On the contrary, variable controller is more flexible and can be able to adapt to complex environment. Considering such advantages, a time-varying algorithm for swarm robotics is presented in this paper. The algorithm takes time as one of the independent variables so that the controller is no longer fixed through the time, but can be changed over time, which brings more choices for the swarm robot system. In this paper, some relevant simulations are designed to test the algorithm. Different control strategies are applied on the same flock during the time, and a more complex, flexible and practical control effect is acquired successfully.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2017.7510685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051307","","Force;Robots;Algorithm design and analysis;Particle swarm optimization;Fans;Aggregates","","7","","","","26 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, an evolutionary random forest (RF) technique that combines the RF algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to model the non-linear relationship between maximum failure depth (MFD) of stope HWs and its influencing variables. The training and verification of RF models were conducted on a dataset collected from the literature, and a total number of 125 valid HW cases were analyzed. The 13 influencing variables were used as inputs. Hyper-parameters of RF models were tuned by PSO with fivefold cross-validation, and the performance of RF models was measured by root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient (R). Experimental results show that the RF algorithm had great potential for predicting the MFD of HWs. The R values between the predicted and actual MFD values were 0.93 and 0.84, respectively. The stope design method was found to be the most significant influencing variable with an importance score of 0.516 out of 1, followed by the RQD of rock mass (0.127), stope strike (0.078), and HW height (0.075).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880009","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201606420046); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8528310","Failure depth prediction;five-fold cross validation;open stope hangingwall;particle swarm optimization;random forest;variable importance","Radio frequency;Training;Prediction algorithms;Regression tree analysis;Vegetation;Forestry;Stability analysis","","7","","35","OAPA","9 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, gain enhancement is realized by loading with one partially reflective surface, which consists of a single dielectric slab with 2-D patches array on both surfaces. Unlike the sharply negative phase slope of conventional cover designs, the proposed one produces a much gentle reflective phase gradient with both negative and positive phase slopes. Thus, the gain property of the MEDA is obviously improved along the whole band. One prototype is fabricated for verification and the results show that the proposed antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth, which is 56.25% for S11 <; -10 dB, ranging from 11.5 to 18.7 GHz.

A difficulty in scaling traditional UTBB is the need for SOI scaling to about one fourth of the gate length. We propose a U-channel fully depleted silicon on insulator architecture that starts off with a thicker SOI (8-11 nm) and has a U-shaped channel enabled by a recessed metal gate. This device improves the electrostatics by increasing the overall gate length at fixed metal gate opening, mitigating drain field coupling to the source due to the recessed metal gate region and having thin SOI below the center of the device (4-5 nm). Modeling shows that good electrostatics can be maintained at small metal gate opening to enable pitch scaling. This device provides lower cost options for mobile and IOT technologies.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2809587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302502","UTBB;U-channel;TCAD;multiple thresholds","Logic gates;Silicon-on-insulator;Silicon;Electrostatics;Cavity resonators;Metals;Junctions","","6","","20","OAPA","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An effort to increase the energy efficiency of these technologies has become a major challenge for future telecommunications systems. The aim of this paper is to develop an energy consumption model for second-generation (2G), third- generation (3G), and fourth-generation (4G) base stations (BSs). In a real network, we investigated the effects of voice and data traffic variations on base-station power consumption. Other features, such as base-station transmitted power, cell availability, or resources allocated to users, were also considered. The models considered supervised learning techniques based on regression analysis, and the result was the predicted base-station power consumption, which was compared with real energy measurements from monitoring equipment installed on site. For validation purposes, metrics such as the Pearson correlation, the root- mean-square error (RMSE), and the mean-absolute-percent error (MAPE), were used. The proposed approach showed the potential of these technologies with regard to energy efficiency, achieving the objective of savings in the power consumption of the operators.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2018.8486764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486764","","Base stations;Power demand;Baseband;3G mobile communication;Correlation;GSM;Current measurement;Global warming","","6","","","","11 Oct 2018","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

By transmitting a sum beam and a difference beam in two orthogonal polarimetric channels, a synthesized transmitted beam with spatially varying polarization is produced, such that the polarization of the transmitted radar wave varies in azimuth or elevation. Thus, the phases of the signals received on the two antennas of a cross-eye jammer become unequal, and an additional phase difference is introduced to disrupt the 180° phase shifting in the retrodirective loop of the jammer. By means of beam scanning in a small angular range, the optimal beam steering configuration can be found to maximize the phase error for the mitigation of cross-eye jamming. As a result, the jamming performance of the cross-eye jammer degrades largely.

With the Al2O3 capping, it forms p-type into ambipolar transport and the electron mobility dramatically increases to 20-110 cm2/V·s in our case. Interestingly, with the O2 post-annealing, the transport can be tuned from ambipolar back to p-type as the annealing time extends. It is attributed that the Al2O3 capping introduces an n-type doping in BP channel while the O2 post-annealing dopes BP back into p-type. Moreover, after the O2 post-annealing the interfacial POx might be formed, resulting in the degradation of subthreshold swing and on/off current ratio.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2804481","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61376008,61774041,U1632121); National Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2015ZX02102-003); Shanghai Pujiang Program, China(grant numbers:16PJ1400800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292842","Black phosphorus;doping;field-effect transistors;ambipolar","Field effect transistors;Aluminum oxide;Annealing;Doping;Phosphorus;Logic gates","","6","","31","OAPA","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper focused on the impact of light color, including correlated color temperature (CCT), color rendering, and spectrum, on dark adaptation at the entrance section of a tunnel. An experiment was performed based on seven kinds of high-power LEDs with different CCTs (3000-6500 K). The experimental results showed that the light color characteristics of LEDs significantly affected dark adaptation. Specifically, the better the color rendering and the lower the absence of blue light, the shorter the dark adaptation time. Among various LEDs with different CCTs, the 4000 K-4500 K LEDs have better light color characteristics and can shorten dark adaptation times. Therefore, LEDs with CCTs of 4000 K-4500 K are preferable for lighting tunnel entrances.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2868829","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701069); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3132016351,3132018189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454785","Light color;photopic vision;dark adaptation time;entrance section.","Lighting;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Light emitting diodes;Pigments;Vehicles","","6","","24","OAPA","5 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we develop a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) structure with the electron-selective p-type Si/titanium dioxide(TiO2)/Al contact as the base-emitter junction, which enables one to separately measure the electron and hole currents across the selective contact. An HBT with a current gain as large as ~220 is achieved. The method is then used to evaluate the current mechanisms across a p-Si/TiO2/Al heterojunction PV cell, where the TiO2/p-Si replaces the n+-p junction. We determine that there is an optimal TiO2 thickness of 4.1 nm for CVD-deposited TiO2; and at the optimal thickness, the hole current is 8% of the total current, thus demonstrating that TiO2/Si is indeed a hole-blocking electron-selective contact. The hole current ratio is corroborated with reverse-recovery experiments, confirming the validity of the HBT method.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2819667","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DMR-1420541); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8343861","Heterojunction;heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT);photovoltaics;selective contact;silicon;titanium dioxide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors;Charge carrier processes;Substrates;Silicon;Junctions;Integrated circuits;Spontaneous emission","","5","","18","OAPA","20 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An ISAR imaging method of maneuvering targets based on phase retrieval is proposed, which can provide a high-resolution and focused map of the spatial distribution of scatterers on the target. According to theoretical derivation, the modulus of raw data from the maneuvering target is not affected by radial motion components for ISAR imaging system, so the phase retrieval algorithm can be used for ISAR imaging problems. However, the traditional phase retrieval algorithm will be not applicable to ISAR imaging under the condition of random noise. To solve this problem, an algorithm is put forward based on the range Doppler (RD) algorithm and oversampling smoothness (OSS) phase retrieval algorithm. The algorithm captures the target information in order to reduce the influence of the random phase on ISAR echoes, and then applies OSS for focusing imaging based on prior information of the RD algorithm. The simulated results demonstrate the validity of this algorithm, which cannot only obtain high resolution imaging for high speed maneuvering targets under the condition of random noise, but also substantially improve the success rate of the phase retrieval algorithm.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.02.08","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355930","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR);maneuvering target;autofocus imaging;phase retrieval;oversampling smoothness (OSS)","Imaging;Radar imaging;Fourier transforms;History;Inverse synthetic aperture radar;High-resolution imaging","","5","","","","10 May 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

It achieves low latency especially for low-volume (or sparse) traffic flows competing with bulk flows. However, the exact conditions for when a particular flow are considered to be sparse has not been well-explored. In this work, we analyze the performance characteristics of the sparse flow optimization of FQ-CoDel, formulating the constraints that flows must satisfy to be considered sparse in a given scenario. We also formulate expressions for the expected queuing latency for sparse flows. Then, using a numerical example, we show that for a given link and a given type of sparse flows (VoIP traffic), the number of sparse flows that a given bottleneck can service with low sparse flow latency is only dependent on the number of backlogged bulk flows at the bottleneck. Furthermore, as long as the maximum number of sparse flows is not exceeded, all sparse flows can expect a very low queuingqueuing latency through the bottleneck.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2871457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8469111","FQ-CoDel;queuing latency;bufferbloat","Optimization;Queueing analysis;Scheduling algorithms;Approximation algorithms;IP networks;Licenses;Upper bound","","5","","11","CCBY","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The time delay is assumed bounded and the upper bound is known. In the technique we propose, the delay affecting the plant to be controlled is treated as an unmodeled uncertainty (in form of multiplicative uncertainty). That uncertainty is approximated and then an H∞ based controller, for the plant represented by the multiplicative uncertainty and the nominal model, is calculated. The obtained H∞ controller is used to control the LTI systems with varying time delays.

For this purpose the carrier trapping/detrapping, which occurs during circuit operation, has to be modeled accurately in addition to the conventional device characteristics. Carrier trapping events prevent device operation according to the ideal carrier dynamics and result in energy losses. It is verified that the influence of the carrier trapping, extracted by dc measurements, is not sufficient. Additionally, the dynamic switching performance must be precisely analyzed to extract the time constants involved in the carrier-trapping events.

However, the dark current density increases as the device is scaled down due to the perimeter surface recombination effect. The photo to dark current ratio at the full depletion voltage of the intrinsic layer (-2.7 V) of the photodiode at 500 °C decreases ~7 times as the size of the photodiode scales down 100 times. The static and dynamic behavior of the photodiodes are modeled with SPICE parameters at the four temperatures.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2017.2785618","Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation as a part of “Working on Venus” Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240922","4H-SiC;photodiode;high temperature;scaling","Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Capacitance-voltage characteristics;Temperature;Avalanche photodiodes;Semiconductor device measurement","","4","","23","OAPA","27 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When dispensing variation of 100 nL was evaluated by using a photometric method, the most stable coefficients of variation (CV) were observed for a tube thickness of 50 μm with hydrophobic treatment, where the average CV value was 1.3%, i.e., 1.3 nL.

And then, the image is modeled as multiple hypergraphs on adaptive scales in which hyper-edges are clustered by means of the agglomerative mean-shift method. The HAM method can get more single-scale hypergraphs and thus has higher accuracy than the previous ones because hypergraphs are constructed on adaptive multi-scales instead of fixed scales.

First, it eliminates the dependence on integration time in calibration process and dramatically suppresses fixed pattern noise by a large attenuation factor. In addition, time-varying offset is real-time canceled by the subtraction of images integrated with normal and short time. Correction error of two-point correction and the proposed method are analyzed in detail. In experiments with cooled infrared camera, the proposed method provides enhanced uniformity even for seven-time variation of integration time using same correction coefficients.

According to light distribution, a method is proposed to evaluate the equal luminance at each RP-divided area. Such equal luminance is expected to develop the FM to reflect rays into the IA with uniform illumination. The simulation results show that average illumination is 20.6 lx in the required area with 90% power efficiency, 85.9% uniformity, and lower glare.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2860796","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(grant numbers:106-2221-E-005-055,106-2622-E-005-007-CC3,106-2622-E-005-018-CC2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8421583","Light-emitting diodes;Illumination design;Nonimaging optics.","Mirrors;Light sources;Frequency modulation;Lighting;Light emitting diodes;Lenses;Maintenance engineering","","4","","17","OAPA","27 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Beamforming can be realized by the Butler matrix, which has been demonstrated in the electric domain. With wireless systems migration toward simplified remote radio units through radio-over-fiber and sharing of signal processing functions located in the central office, it is desirable to implement this beamforming technique in the optical domain. In this paper, we propose an optical implementation of the Butler matrix using purely passive optical components such as directional couplers and delay lines. With the additional use of optical routing elements, the number of signal streams connected to the baseband unit equals the number of the actual users rather than the number of antenna elements, thereby achieving hardware efficiency for multiuser beamforming. Moreover, the proposed optical Butler matrix acts on the optical intensity rather than the optical field, and therefore, low-cost intensity-modulation direct-detection (IMDD) optical transceivers can be used. A proof-of-concept experiment is conducted to demonstrate the optical 2 × 2 Butler matrix. Scaling the optical Butler matrix to high port counts is also discussed.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2805875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295006","Microwave photonics;optical fibers;phased arrays;beam steering;Butler matrices;optical interconnections","Butler matrices;Optical fibers;Array signal processing;Radio frequency;Optical signal processing;Optical network units","","4","","20","OAPA","19 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel approach to designing an image mapper that can be used in IMS to reduce cross talk between adjacent sub-pupils. To verify the proposed method, an imaging model based on scalar diffraction theory is derived and computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the improvement that is realized compared with the original method. In addition, image mappers designed by both the proposed approach and the original approach are fabricated. The simulation and experimental results show that there is a reduction of about 30%-70% in the cross talk obtained using the novel image mapper, which proves that the proposed approach is effective and has advantages in improving the data quality of the IMS.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2834485","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61635002); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4172038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356003","Hyperspectral imaging;modeling;optimization;spectroscopy","Mirrors;Imaging;Apertures;Computational modeling;Diffraction;Optical diffraction","","4","","20","OAPA","8 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Characteristic curve shifting due to selective reflection from color surfaces was analyzed based on a laboratory CCM system developed by the authors' team. Theoretically, when the color of the targeted surface is different from that represented by the central wavelength of the light source, the characteristic curve of CCM would have a notable deviation from that of an achromatic surface. In this study, this conclusion was verified through both simulation and experiments. Using a set of standard color calibration pieces, a color correction method was proposed accordingly to quantify the characteristic curve shifting. To validate the proposed method, a laser scanning confocal microscope Carl Zeiss LSM700 was used as the referencing system. Experimental data showed that with the color correction method, measurement errors can be controlled within 10 nm.

Evaluation of crude protein content in microwave heated red kidney beans are carried out using standard Kjeldahl method and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. Red kidney beans affected by Pulse Beetle (Callosobruchus chinensis) have been analyzed throughout the experiments. The heat treatment of the samples is undertaken using a domestic microwave oven at 2.45 GHz. The samples are heated at different microwave powers, such as 90, 270, 450, 750, and 900 W, while the exposure time is varied from 30-90 s. The effective microwave power for maximum disinfestation is found to be 270-450 W at 30-60 s. Most of the red kidney beans are damaged at 900 W for 60 s. Using Kjeldahl method, a constant crude protein level of 22.5 % is obtained for untreated and treated samples at 90-450 W. Crude protein level of red kidney beans is changed at 750-900 W. From FTIR analysis, the absorbance spectrum of carbohydrate peaks is found at 900-1250 cm-1, a moisture peak at 1650 cm-1, and a protein peaks at 2800-3000 cm-1. Statistical analysis of the treated and untreated samples represents the lowest error of 0.0016 at 450 W power level for 60 s. Variances are determined to be the lowest with a value of 270 W and 450 W at 90 s and 60 s.

With the increase of the propagation distance, one of the optical vortices that are broken down and one of the optical vortices that are evolved will annihilate.

In this paper, the novel Ba2Y(BO3)2Cl:Bi3+, Yb3+ quantum cutting phosphors were prepared, and their quantum cutting luminescence and energy transfer mechanism were investigated. The visual emission of Bi3+ was observed ranging from 350 to 650 nm, which is attributed to the 3P1→1S0 transition of Bi3+. The near infrared emission ranging from 950 to 1100 nm is due to the 2F7/2→2F5/2 transition of Yb3+. The cooperative energy transfer mechanism from the Bi 3+ to Yb3+ in Ba2Y(BO3)2Cl:Bi3+, Yb3+ phosphor was investigated, and their cooperative energy transfer process could be expressed as the Bi 3+(3P1)→Yb3+(2F5/2) + Yb3+(2F5/2).

Unfortunately, the theoretical security cannot guarantee practical security, because several possible weaknesses may exist in the actual implementation. These weaknesses likely come from the masking schemes or are introduced by the implementation methods. Finding the possible weakness of the masking scheme is an interesting and important issue for real applications. In this paper, the possible weaknesses for masking schemes in Field- Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design are discussed. It was found that the combinational circuit is the key to the security of masking schemes. The Toggle Count (TC) method and its extension are utilized to evaluate the security of masking schemes in the design phase and the implementation phase separately. Comparing different logic-level simulators for the Xilinx FPGA platform, the behavioral and post-translate simulations are considered as the analysis method in the design phase, while the post-map and the post-route simulations are used to find the weakness during the implementation phase. Moreover, a Standard Delay Format (SDF) based improvement scheme is proposed to significantly increase the effectiveness of the TC model.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450870","Side-Channel Attack (SCA); toggle count; masking; simulation-based analysis","Integrated circuit modeling;Combinational circuits;Analytical models;Power demand;Semiconductor device modeling;Security;Logic gates","","3","","","","16 Sep 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

The results show a serious bit-error rate (BER) fluctuation as well as a large power penalty for the PAM4 signal after the 12.2-km long MMF transmission. We identify that the power penalty and BER fluctuations are caused by the signal-to-interference beat noise generated in the SMF-pigtailed receiver, resulting from the small portion of the signal (~5%) unwantedly carried by the high-order modes of MMF. However, we can suppress this beat noise by replacing the SMF-pigtailed receiver with the MMF-pigtailed one since all modes are orthogonal in MMF. For example, when we utilize this proposed method, the power penalty of the 25.78-Gb/s PAM4 signal measured after the transmission over 12.2 km of MMF is reduced from 3.9 to 0.9 dB (@ BER = 5×10-5).

This is followed by trellis code-aided mapping of additional bits to space-time codes of the expanded set. Trellis code-aided mapping of additional bits enhances the bandwidth efficiency of the proposed DSTBC scheme. The proposed scheme sends more information bits in each transmitted space-time code than the conventional differential detection-aided DSTBC (CDD-DSTBC) scheme, and yet retains the same error performance. For each additional bit sent with the transmitted space-time codeword, the proposed scheme using 16QAM achieves a 12.5% increase in bandwidth efficiency, while the scheme using 64QAM realises an 8.3% increase. Simulation results demonstrate that the error performance of the proposed scheme tightly matches that of CDD-DSTBC with improvement in bandwidth efficiency.

The dual phase windings of the BLDC motor are integrated into the circuit in the starting stage. When the motor's back EMF value is equal to the terminal voltage value, switch off a set of RST three phase windings whose back EMF coefficient is bigger and make the other set of stator winding UVW with smaller back EMF coefficient continue to operate under the rated power. As the motor rotor speed continues to increase, the electromagnetic torque remains unchanged.

This paper focuses on the waveform design for radar and the extended target in the environment of electronic warfare. Three different countermeasure models between smart radar and dumb target, smart target and dumb radar, smart radar and smart target are proposed. Taking the signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) as the metric, optimized waveforms for the first two scenarios are achieved by the general water-filling method in the presence of clutter. For the last case, the equilibrium between smart radar and smart target in the presence of clutter is given mathematically and the optimized solution is achieved through a novel two-step water-filling method on the basis of minmax theory. Simulation results under different power constraints show the power allocation strategies of radar and target and the output SINRs are analyzed.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.01.05","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320425","waveform design;extended target;electronic warfare;clutter;water-filling method","Radar countermeasures;Jamming;Clutter;Signal to noise ratio;Radar clutter","","3","","","","22 Mar 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Due to this, most of prior work on fall detection has focused on simulated datasets acquired in scenarios that mimic the real-world context, however, the validation of systems trained with simulated falls remains unclear. This work presents a transfer learning approach for combining a dataset of simulated falls and non-falls, obtained from young volunteers, with the real-world FARSEEING dataset, in order to train a set of supervised classifiers for discriminating between falls and non-falls events. The objective is to analyze if a combination of simulated and real falls could enrich the model. In the real-world, falls are a sporadic event, which results in imbalanced datasets. In this work, several methods for imbalance learning were employed: SMOTE, Balance Cascade and Ranking models. The Balance Cascade obtained less misclassifications in the validation set.There was an improvement when mixing the real falls and simulated non-falls compared to the case when only simulated falls were used for training. When testing with a mixed set with real falls and simulated non-falls, it is even more important to train with a mixed set. Moreover, it was possible to conclude that a model trained with simulated falls generalize better when tested with real falls, than the opposite.

Several approaches have been explored to address this problem, notably measures that would minimize burstification delays, congestion, blocking at the same time enhancing end-to-end throughput as well as rational and fair utilization of the links. The aim is to achieve a consistent quality of service (QoS). Noting that congestion minimization is key to a consistent QoS provisioning, in this paper we propose a congestion management approach called enhanced congestion management (ECM) that seeks to guarantee a consistent QoS as well as rational and fair use of available links. It is primarily a service differentiation based scheme that aims at congestion, blocking and latency minimization, by way of combining time averaged delay segmented burstification as well as random shortest path selection based deflection routing and wavelength assignment. Simulation results show that ECM can effectively minimise congestion and at the same time improve both throughput and effective utilization, under moderate to high network traffic conditions. Overall, we show that the approach guarantees a consistent QoS.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2018.8531799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531799","Optical burst switching (OBS);service differentiation;streamline effect (SLE);effective utilization;ineffective utilization;segmentation;random shortest path selection","Optical buffering;Optical switches;Quality of service;Loss measurement;Optical fibers;Optical packet switching;Delays","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

The 2nd-order sidebands generated by the SSB modulator and the maximum-biased MZM can be cancelled by controlling the sideband amplitude and phase.

However, there is limited research on the investigation of 2-D magnetic properties affected by laminated direction mechanical stress, as few mature devices could be employed, since the traditional B-H sensing coils are easily damaged by laminated direction stress. Therefore, the sensing structure with cubic specimen is proposed for 2-D magnetic properties measurement considering laminated direction stress. The printed circuit board (PCB)-based B-H sensing coils, which are attached to the surrounding surface of the cubic specimen, could be free of the impact of the z-direction mechanical stress. The accuracy of B-H sensing part is analyzed in detail by means of the finite-element method as well as experiments.

Generally, the analysis of back-EMF for the machine with complex electromagnetic structure such as DCHES machine should utilize 3-D finite element analysis (FEA), which will require huge resources and computing time. In order to avoid using 3-D FEA to analyze the back-EMF of complex structure, an analytical method of calculating back-EMF is presented in this paper. The electromagnetic field in 3-D space can be simplified as a 2-D field by dividing the 3-D field into several simple zones, the resultant effect equals to the summation of every single 2-D field's effect. According to electromagnetic theory, the analytical formula of back-EMF is obtained on the basis of Fourier series. The influence of main parameters on back-EMF waveform under sine and trapezoidal flux distribution is discussed respectively. The theoretical result shows that the trapezoidal air-gap flux distribution would generate a sine back-EMF.

For low-rate sampling of echo signals, several kinds of compressive sampling (CS) pulse-Doppler (CSPD) radar are developed with different analog-to-information conversion (AIC) systems. However, a unified metric is absent to evaluate their parameter estimation performance. Towards this end, this paper derives the deterministic Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the joint delay-Doppler estimation of CSPD radar to quantitatively analyze the estimate performance. Theoretical results reveal that the CRBs of both time-delays and Doppler shifts are inversely proportional to the received target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of transmitted pulses and the sampling rate of AIC systems. The main difference is that the CRB of Doppler shifts also lies on the coherent processing interval. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical results. They also show that the structure of the AIC systems has weak influence on the CRBs, which implies that the AIC structures can be flexibly selected for the implementation of CSPD radar.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.01.06","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320426","compressive sampling (CS);delay-Doppler estimation;Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)","Doppler radar;Doppler shift;Signal to noise ratio;Cramer-Rao bounds;Bandwidth","","3","","","","22 Mar 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The polymeric thin films produced by the nonconjugated polymers were spin-coated on ITO coated glass and Si substrates. Self-assembly nanoparticles (1.6-6.2 nm) are observed. It is proposed that the nanoparticle is constructed through a self-assembly process with bisphenol-A aggregates and poly(ethylene glycol) moieties. The photoluminescence spectrum of the polymeric thin film on ITO peaks at near 450 nm that spans from 360 to 610 nm under 266 nm excitation. The polymeric thin film exhibits the excitation-wavelength-dependent photoluminescence that the emission peak shifts toward longer wavelength (about 11 nm) when the excitation wavelength increases from 266 to 325 nm, which is attributed to nanoparticle size distribution. Meanwhile, the substrate-dependent photoluminescence has been also observed that the PL peak of the polymeric thin film spin-coated on Si shows a blue shift (about 9 nm) compared with that on ITO, which probably arises from the dielectric screening. The highest occupied molecular orbital energy of the polymeric thin film is about -9.4 eV. The optical band gap is about 3.28 eV.

Two approaches are proposed to model the disturbance torque. Firstly, the gravity induced moment, the vortex torque, and the damping moment are modeled separately. However, the vortex torque and the damping moment are coupled with each other as both of them are caused by the viscosity. In the second approach, the coupling effect is considered. A nano-satellite is constructed based on aerostatic bearing. The time history of the free rotation rate from an initial speed is measured by the gyro, which is further used to calculate the rotation angle and acceleration. The static vortex torque is measured via the removable micro-torque measurement system. Based on these data, the model parameters are identified and modeling errors are presented. Results show that the second model is more precise. The root mean squire error is less than 0.5×10-4 N·m and the relative error of the static vortex torque is 0.16%.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.03.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8407059","aerostatic bearing;disturbance torque;vortex torque;spacecraft simulator;modeling and identification","Torque;Damping;Shafts;Viscosity;Gravity;Modeling;Wheels","","2","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

In this letter, we investigate room-temperature transient absorption properties in visible region of KDP crystals irradiated by a nanosecond ultraviolet (UV) laser at 355 nm. Both the transient absorption spectra and the absorption decay properties are presented and discussed. Transient absorption spectrum of KDP under UV laser irradiation shows a broad absorption band with maximum at about 560 nm. The observed transient absorption band in the KDP crystal is suggested to arise from laser-induced electronic defects identified as hole centers. The decay dynamics of hole center absorption is described by a model of electron tunneling recombination assisted by thermal diffusion. Generation of such defects under UV laser irradiation is considered to have a relationship with initial defects existed in the KDP crystal lattice. A defect-mediated nonlinear absorption model was proposed to explain the hole center generation processes under UV laser irradiation.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2876459","Science Challenge Project(grant numbers:JCKY2016212A506-0503); Foundation of Science and Technology on Plasma Physics Laboratory(grant numbers:9140C680106150C68295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496868","Nonlinear crystals;spectroscopy","Absorption;Transient analysis;Radiation effects;Crystals;Measurement by laser beam;Laser excitation;Impurities","","2","","28","OAPA","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, by using high-order singular value decomposition techniques, we derive a high-order affinity model directly from the Ncut relaxation formula, called high-order normalized cut (HNcut). However, in practice, it cannot directly utilize the high-order affinity matrix because of the computational resources required. To address this issue, we adopt and improve various techniques to make the proposed method more practical such as sampling strategy.

This study is designed to assess the degree to which VNS is likely to cause interference in the cardiac sensing of an implantable cardiac rhythm management device. Methods: A VNS stimulation lead and a cardiac sensing lead were placed in a simulated biological medium. A nonconductive carrier frame was used to position the leads at a precise electrode spacing. Stimulation was delivered through the VNS Therapy lead at a maximum output current and a variety of combinations of stimulation frequencies from 5-30 Hz and stimulation pulse widths from 130-1000 μs. The electrode spacing began at 0 cm and was increased in 1 cm increments until the measured signal dropped below the cardiac rhythm management device noise floor for sensing. The test was conducted with both bipolar and unipolar sensing. Results: In the bipolar sensing configuration, the maximum sensed signal amplitude was 687 μV at an electrode separation of 0 cm, signal frequency of 30 Hz, pulse width of 1000 μs, and output current of 3.5 mA. In the unipolar sensing configuration, the maximum amplitude was 406 μV. In both configurations, the measured signal with maximum stimulation intensity decreased significantly with electrode separation, and dropped below the noise floor at an electrode spacing of 3.0 cm. The sensed signal amplitude was further attenuated at lower stimulation amplitudes and pulse widths. Conclusion: Even at maximum neural stimulation intensity of 3.5 mA, at an electrode separation of at least 3.0 cm, neural stimulation did not result in a detectable level of interference with either bipolar or unipolar sensing. Because this separation is significantly smaller than the minimum electrode separation of 15 cm in clinical practice, VNS Therapy is not expected to interfere with the function of implantable cardiac devices.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513067","","Sensors;Electrodes;Medical treatment;Lead;Interference;Rhythm;Current measurement","Autonomic Nervous System;Heart;Heart Failure;Heart Rate;Humans;Vagus Nerve;Vagus Nerve Stimulation","2","","13","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to pure electric or magnetic multiple Fano resonances, the mixed electric/magnetic multiple Fano resonances provide more flexibility for their application in multiwavelength surface enhanced Raman scattering and biosensing. Whereas, the dramatic difference between the two Fano resonances makes it difficult to realize magnetic and electric Fano resonances together in the same structure. In this paper, magnetic-octupole mode based Fano resonance and electric-quadrupole mode based Fano resonances in optical frequency were together achieved in a combined square-shaped split-ring resonator with an internal square nanoantenna nanocavities. The two Fano resonances are switchable by adjusting the polarization of the incident light. The lineshape modulated by the geometry and the environment of the two Fano resonances was investigated. Both the Fano resonances show high sensitivity to the environment. This study reveals a new multiple Fano resonance constitution and the proposed structure, which are expected with benefit application in multiwavelength polarization modulated chemistry and biological sensing.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2792426","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11664016); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2012CB933004,2015CB932403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255618","Fano resonance;sensor;plasmonic modes","Magnetic resonance;Plasmons;Bonding;Couplings;Magnetic moments;Magnetomechanical effects","","2","","34","OAPA","12 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Calculation for a large-scale complex network's diameter has been an important subject in the study of complex networks. If the network diameter is calculated directly, the problem mainly exists in efficiency for searching and counting the shortest paths. If the network diameter is calculated indirectly by studying the statistical function about the relationship between the network diameter and parameters affecting the diameter, the problems not only exist in the efficiency of statistic, but also exist in the function which may be not applicable to all kinds of networks. An algorithm for the complex network diameter based on the k order distance matrix is proposed with a matrix multiplication approach, and a mathematical proof for the algorithm correctness is given as well. Furthermore, some relevant propositions and deductions for reducing the complexity of this algorithm are put forward. With a good theoretical basis and a simple calculation process, this algorithm can be used to calculate the diameter of a large-scale complex network with small-world effect more accurately and efficiently.

Therefore, it is necessary to design the bus bar geometry while considering the minimization and optimization of the parasitic inductance of bus bar. This paper discusses a relationship between bus bar geometry and switching characteristics. In addition, the bus bar analysis is based on the PEEC method, and the bus bar geometry is designed by considering the stray inductance with using an inductance-map method. Moreover, this paper also presents a design procedure of acceptable stray inductance based on a standardization method. It should be noted that the stray inductance is designed not for minimization, but optimization, and it is shown not as an absolute value(H), but as a percentage value(%).

Typically, one side of a neckband speaker consists of a microspeaker driver integrated in a speaker box and a linear vibrator independent of the speaker box. In this paper, a practical design of a passive radiator integrated in the speaker box is proposed as a substitute for the linear vibrator. Therefore, both of the microspeaker driver and the passive vibrator are integrated in the speaker box. 2-DOF theory is used to model the system, and parameters are identified using Klippel and the analytical method. The sound pressure is obtained by the boundary element method. First, the prototype of a passive vibrator is built by using a center diaphragm and a side diaphragm. Then, the parameters of the prototypes are determined. An acceleration test is conducted to check the vibrator performance. Finally, an optimized vibrator is manufactured by using the analytical method. The sound pressure level (SPL) and acceleration are determined and conduct a response time experiment. The results show that the SPL values obtained through both of the experiment and simulation show good agreement and that there is only 2 dB sacrificed owing to the passive vibrator. The acceleration experiment results show that the optimized passive vibrator can generate 1.5 Grms at 130 Hz; this represents an improvement of 60% compared with the prototype. Furthermore, the response time of the passive vibrator is 20 ms. The proposed passive vibrator can be used to develop commercial neckband speakers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2803745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8286850","Passive vibrator;speaker box;sound pressure level;acceleration","Prototypes;Vibrations;Mathematical model;Acceleration;Resistance;Parameter estimation;Time factors","","2","","9","OAPA","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Failure of some nodes can trigger a cascading failure, which completely fragments the network, necessitating recovery efforts to improve robustness of complex systems. Inspired by real-world scenarios, this paper proposes repair models after two kinds of network failures, namely complete and incomplete collapse. In both models, three kinds of repair strategies are possible, including random selection (RS), node selection based on single network node degree (SD), and node selection based on double network node degree (DD). We find that the node correlation in each of the two coupled networks affects repair efficiency. Numerical simulation and analysis results suggest that the repair node ratio and repair strategies may have a significant impact on the economics of the repair process. The results of this study thus provide insight into ways to improve the robustness of coupled networks after cascading failures.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.03.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8407062","networks reliability;interdependent networks;recovery strategy;cascading failure","Maintenance engineering;Power system faults;Power system protection;Couplings;Robustness;Modeling","","2","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The designed circuit can withstand the loads and the set voltage range so as to supply the connected load for any voltage variation between 220 and 240 Volts. It can be used to protect loads such as refrigerator, TV, VCR/DVD player etc. against undesirable over and under voltage conditions as well as surges caused due to sudden failure of power supply mains. This device can also be used directly as standalone equipment between the supply mains and the load. The over/under voltage and over current cut-off with time delay provides over/under-voltage and over current protection and also protection against any transients.","2367-0983","","10.1186/s41601-018-0101-5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10368122","Distribution system;Protective device;Microcontroller;Over -under voltage;Over current","Voltage fluctuations;TV;Costs;Microcontrollers;Delay effects;Water pumps;Power system reliability","","2","","11","","21 Dec 2023","","","PSPC","PSPC Journals"

The first issue is the High Frequency Resonance(HFR) mode due to the impedance interaction between the DFIG system and the weak grid. In order to ensure safe and reliable operation of the DFIG system, it is necessary to implement effective active damping strategies to mitigate the HFR. The second issue is low order voltage harmonic distortion at the Point of Common Coupling(PCC), where consequently the performance of other grid-connected devices may deteriorate. It could be advantageous that the DFIG system is able to improve the voltage quality at PCC by eliminating the low order harmonic components. In this paper, both of the above mentioned DFIG operational characters, i.e., active damping of HFR and the improvement of voltage quality at PCC, will be achieved by implementing advanced control strategies in the Rotor Side Converter(RSC) and the Grid Side Converter(GSC) respectively.

Hence, phase factor sequences can be optimized to reduce their searching times.

The key device in the proposed technique is a dual-polarization quadrature phase-shift keying modulator, whose two sub-dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulators are both biased as a carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulator but generating two opposite first-order optical sidebands. The phase difference between the orthogonally polarized two first-order optical sidebands and the polarization state of the optical signal are tuned independently by a polarization controller. After the optical signal from the polarization controller is combined via a polarizer and detected at a photodetector, a frequency-doubled microwave signal is generated, whose phase and amplitude can be independently controlled by tuning the polarization controller. An experiment is performed. Frequency-doubled microwave signals with carrier frequencies from 10 to 40 GHz are generated and phase shifted over 360° phase range with arbitrary signal amplitude. The proposed technique can not only be operated as a phase and amplitude tunable frequency-doubled microwave source, but also find applications in phased array radar systems as a wideband frequency-doubled multichannel phase shifter.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2854780","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601297); Open Fund of IPOC; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409276","Microwave photonics;phase shifter;frequency doubling;phase noise.","Microwave photonics;Optical polarization;Microwave circuits;Microwave oscillators;Optical modulation;Frequency modulation","","1","","24","OAPA","10 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, energy detection (ED) based on the jamming to noise ratio (JNR) of the high frequency bands SCAJ receiver with phase noise under different channels is analyzed. Then, the probabilities of jamming detection and false alarm in closed-form for the SCAJ receiver are derived. Finally, the modified Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) of jamming sensing for the SCAJ receiver is presented. Simulation results show that the performance degradation of the SCAJ system due to phase noise is more severe than that due to the channel fading in the circumstances where the signal bandwidth (BW) is kept a constant. Moreover, the signal BW has an effect on the phase noise in LO, and the jamming detection probability of the wideband SCAJ receiver with lower phase noise outperforms that of the narrowband receiver using the same center frequency. Furthermore, an accurate phase noise estimation and compensation scheme can improve the jamming detection capability of the SCAJ receiver in high frequency bands and approach to the upper bound.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.01.03","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320423","high frequency band;simultaneous transmit and receive;phase noise;cognitive anti-jamming","Receivers;Phase noise;Jamming;Sensors;Silicon;Fading channels;Communication systems","","1","","","","22 Mar 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

The stator windings structure, drive converter configurations and control model of the AHT-PMSM are illustrated firstly. And then the harmonic characteristics of the MMF generated by permanent magnets and armature currents are analyzed. It is found that the MMFs of permanent magnets and armature currents include the same order harmonics and each order harmonic is orthonormal for each other. Finally the calculation process of the average electromagnetic torque for AHT-PMSM based on harmonic MMFs is deduced. It is demonstrated that the theoretical average electromagnetic torque of AHT-PMSM is improved by 23% comparing to that of the normal sinusoidal PMSM when they are with the same structure sizes and armature MMFs.

Here, the fabrication and characterization of a triple-emitter light-induced synaptic device artificial synapse is proposed to mimic excitatory postsynaptic voltage (EPSV) summation of the biological nervous system. When repetitive-pulse signals with different periods are synchronously applied to three presynaptic terminals, temporal, and spatial EPSV summations lead to synaptic strengthening. Resonant spatiotemporal correlations occur because the continuous activities make the presynaptic inputs correlate with respect to each other. Experimental results demonstrate three different resonant EPSV correlations generated by a combination of each of the two repetitive-pulse signals, which agree well with the simulations based on the convolution operation and the nonlinear distortion function. These results suggest that the multiple-emitter light-induced artificial synapse is promising for the emulation of biological neural networks.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2018.2808282","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61531166004); Special Project(grant numbers:2016YFE0118400); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BE2016186); “111” Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8299422","Multiple-emitter light-induced artificial synapse;excitatory postsynaptic voltage;resonant spatiotemporal correlation","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Synapses;Quantum well devices;Neurons;Correlation;Optical waveguides","","1","","20","OAPA","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Protein structures are known to be formed of domains; structural and functional subunits that are often repeated across sets of proteins. These domains generally form compact, globular regions, and are therefore often easily identifiable by inspection, yet the problem of automatically fragmenting the protein into these compact substructures remains computationally challenging. Existing domain classification methods focus on finding subregions of protein structure that are conserved, rather than finding a decomposition which spans the full protein structure. However, such a decomposition would find ready application in coarse-graining molecular dynamics, analysing the protein's topology, in de novo protein design and in fitting electron microscopy maps. Here, we present a tool for performing this modular decomposition using the Infomap community detection algorithm. The protein structure is abstracted into a network in which its amino acids are the nodes, and where the edges are generated using a simple proximity test. Infomap can then be used to identify highly intra-connected regions of the protein. We perform this decomposition systematically across 4000 distinct protein structures, taken from the Protein Data Bank. The decomposition obtained correlates well with existing PFAM sequence classifications, but has the advantage of spanning the full protein, with the potential for novel domains. The coarse-grained network formed by the communities can also be used as a proxy for protein topology at the single-chain level; we demonstrate that grouping these proteins by their coarse-grained network results in a functionally significant classification.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cny014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668853","community detection;protein structure;biological networks;spatial networks","","","1","","","","21 Mar 2019","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The grating selects a specific whispering-gallery mode with the proper emission pattern (radially polarized emission) to lase and simultaneously scatters the mode vertically to form the surface emission. Through numerical simulations, RPSEL is predicted to be a single-mode laser with radially polarized surface emission. RPSEL can be rather easily realized at different wavelengths such as the near infrared 1310 and 1550 nm wavelength bands. Furthermore, it can be fabricated with microcylinder cavities with very small radii even down to wavelength-scale, therefore it has the potential to realize very high modulation bandwidth and very low threshold current.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2797168","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0402304); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8287808","Surface-emitting lasers;microcavity devices;diffraction gratings","Gratings;Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers;Cavity resonators;Laser modes;Magnetic fields;Electric fields","","1","","13","OAPA","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To declare high-level monitoring objectives and obtain their values from OPMs, finding a methodology to accurately estimate the value of a target quantity and ensure their operational range is necessary. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) with a digital coherent receiver to ML-based OPMs to deal with the abundance of training data needed for convergence and the preprocessing of input data by human engineers needed for feature (representation) extraction. However, guaranteeing the operational range of trained models on DNN-based OPMs was left for another investigation. To address this issue with DNN-based OPMs, we propose an ""operational range expander,"" a simple treatment of the link between pre-processing training datasets and their specified operational range. We assess the operational range expander by performing simulation and experimentation using a DNNbased optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) estimator. We select a laser frequency offset between a signal and a local oscillator in digital coherent receivers as an example quantity for a practical operational range expander in this study. This is because the OPMs need to work before digitally compensating frequency offset despite the difficulty in fully controlling frequency offset in practical situations. We evaluate bias errors and standard deviations of OSNR estimation from different frequency offsets ranging from -3.5 to 3.5 GHz and confirm that the provided operational range expander specified the operational range of DNNbased OSNR estimators through their training phase.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.10.000D63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8501528","Digital coherent reception; Machine learning;Optical fiber communication; Optical performancemonitoring.","Monitoring;Optical receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Training;Optical noise;Optical polarization","","1","","","","24 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Resource collections can be used in wireless sensor networks to improve bandwidth usage and to reduce energy consumption, reducing the overall number of notification packets and wrapping overhead, required for the delivery of sensor data.

The structural complexity of the coupler and the boundary discontinuity makes analyzing and improving the light energy coupling efficiency challenging. A dual-fiber spherical coupler, widely used in many fields, has a rather low coupling efficiency of 10%. The reasons for such low coupling efficiency have not yet been discussed, and effective methods for improving the coupling efficiency of this coupler have not been proposed. The coupling efficiency of the coupler is analyzed by using a proposed one-dimensional quantum tunneling model, and a polished spherical coupler is designed and fabricated to improve it. The main reason for the low coupling efficiency is that light has a rather high probability of refracting and then escaping at the boundary and that light reflects too many times inside the coupler. The polished coupler proposed effectively improved the coupling efficiency from 10% to 22.9%. This study will help researchers to design spherical couplers and promote their potential use.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2854837","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51575140); Youth Talents Foundation of Harbin(grant numbers:RC2016JQ006007,.); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409446","Coupling efficiency;dual-fiber;spherical coupler.","Couplers;Optical fiber couplers;Couplings;Reflection;Optical fiber sensors","","1","","16","OAPA","10 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to locate the disturbance source accurately is an important issue to low frequency oscillation disposal. Existing methods have poor adaptability to the low frequency oscillation with time-varying steady-state points because of the limitations in the location criterion derivation. A disturbance source location method on a low frequency oscillation with good generality is presented in the paper. Firstly, the reasons why the steady-state points are time-varying on a low frequency oscillation are analyzed. Then, based on the energy function construction form, the branch transmission energy is decomposed into state energy, reciprocating energy and dissipation energy by mathematical derivation.

Based on the transmittance characterization of biological tissue, such as brains, four NIR optical windows have been demonstrated or suggested: The 800-nm, the 1300-nm, the 1700-nm, and the 2200-nm window. High-numerical aperture objective lenses are needed in optical microscopy to both deliver sufficient excitation light and collect efficient signal light to enable deep-tissue imaging. The transmittance performances of objective lenses are of vital importance. However, there is a lack of experimental characterization of the transmittance, especially at long wavelengths, which poses a dramatic obstacle for lens selection in imaging experiments. Here, we demonstrate detailed measurement results of the transmittance performance of air, water-immersion, and oil-immersion objectives available to us, covering all the four NIR optical windows. These results will provide direct guidelines for objective lens selection in terms of transmittance performance. We further demonstrate three-photon microscopy with 1820-nm excitation, close to the edge of the 1700-nm window, using the objective lens based on our transmittance measurement.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2828435","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61475103); Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen(grant numbers:KQJSCX20160226194151,JCYJ20160307150657874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352115","Fluorescence microscopy;nonlinear microscopy;multiphoton processes","Lenses;Optical imaging;Microscopy;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical microscopy;Optical variables measurement","","1","","18","OAPA","27 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The confidence bound, called the grid ionospheric vertical error (GIVE), can only be determined with the aid of a threat model which is used to restrict the expected ionospheric behavior. However, the spatial threat model at present widespread used, which is based on fit radius and relative centroid metric (RCM), is too conservative or the resulting GIVEs will be too large and will reduce the availability of satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS). In this paper, layered two-dimensional parameters, the vertical direction double RCMs, are introduced based on the spatial variability of the ionosphere. Comparing with the traditional threat model, the experimental results show that the user ionospheric vertical error (UIVE) average reduction rate reaches 16%.

There are two main contributions: the first involves a method for feature extraction based on AdaBoost, which selects features critical for coordinating operations of experienced drivers and inexperienced drivers, and the second involves a generating method for candidate features, called the combined features method, through which two or more different driving operations at the same location are combined into a candidate combined feature. A series of experiments based on driving simulator and specific course with several different curves were carried out, and the result indicated the feasibility of analyzing driving behavior through AdaBoost and the combined features method.

In these centers, decisions to improve clinic flow must account for the high degree of interdependence when critical personnel or equipment is shared between clinics. Discrete event simulation models have provided clinical decision support, but rarely address high-volume clinics with shared resources. While highly complex models are now capable of representing clinics in detail, validation techniques often do not evaluate model predictive performance when presented with new data. Cross-validation provides a means to evaluate the robustness of model treatment time predictions when ongoing data collection in clinics is impractical. Ensuring robust predictions assures validity in the use of models to optimize clinic performance. We apply cross-validation in evaluating a model of glaucoma clinic service at Duke Eye Center. In-person observation is used to verify the accuracy of operations data collected through electronic health records (EHR). From the EHR data, we formulate a stochastic reward net model, employing phase-type distributions to represent treatment durations, and solved through discrete event simulation. The model is formulated in two configurations to represent (1) concurrent demand on clinic staff, or (2) independently functioning clinics. Evaluating these two alternatives in cross-validation studies, we find model prediction accuracy improves when interdependence is explicitly modeled in the examined setting.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513569","","Data models;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Training;Medical services","Ambulatory Care Facilities;Data Collection;Delivery of Health Care;Electronic Health Records;Glaucoma;Humans;Patient Care","1","","12","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, we propose an efficient algorithm to assess the feasibility of these DPs. Comprehensive experiments on linear hyper-plane regression and non-linear homography matrix estimation show that our approach is fully deterministic and can effectively process large-scale and highly corrupted data without any special initialization.

I have learned a lot during these years from the women I have interviewed. Some scientists have been born in scientific dynasties: it has not been a big issue to continue on that path. This is valid for both genders. These people may have already learned the science jargon as kids, received support from home, and advice on how to avoid the pitfalls.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2018.8627432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8627432","","Physics;Engineering profession;Organizations;Sports;STEM;Equal opportunities","","","","","","27 Jan 2019","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

A. Zadeh is a special inspiring leader in cybernetics and machine intelligence. As a tribute to his pioneer work in fuzzy sets theory, this paper follows his treatment in fuzzy membership functions and operations and introduces the factors space theory which further explains the relationships between them. The factors space theory calculates the membership degree of a human concept by first surveying the sampling interval statistics around a concept, and then introducing the vision of ‘falling shadow’ to convert the covering probability of a random interval in the power set of the concept domain to membership degree. This paper introduces the factorial probability and transfers typical probability density to typical falling membership curves. Based on this idea, a subjective scoring system used on fuzzy evaluation and decision-making is suggested. Facing the question on the selection of fuzzy operations, the paper indicates that the source is in the joint distribution of random sets and a selection proposition is given. Factors space opens a new frontier for the developments of fuzzy sets theory.","1616-8666","","10.1080/16168658.2018.1509518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10480387","Fuzzy sets;artificial intelligence;probability;factors space;falling shadow theory","Fuzzy sets;Evidence theory;Decision making;Probability;Solids;Fuzzy set theory;Machine intelligence","","","","30","","27 Mar 2024","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

A corrupted message having errors that is less than or equal to half the minimum distance corresponds to a unique codeword and therefore, the probability of decoding error is one for a minimum distance decoder. However, increasing the decoding radius to be slightly higher than half of the minimum distance may result in multiple codewords within the Hamming sphere. In this study, we computed the probability of having unique codewords for (7,k) RS codes when the decoding radius is increased from the error correcting capability t to t+1. Simulation results show a significant effect of the code rates on the probability of having unique codewords. It also shows that the probability of having unique codeword for low rate codes is close to one.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2018.8532191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8532191","Reed Solomon codes;Minimum distance decoder;Bounded distance decoding;Unique codeword;Hamming sphere","Decoding;Probability;Reed-Solomon codes;Forward error correction;Mathematical model;Amplitude modulation;Numerical analysis","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Recent work shows that the exponent characterizing the temperature dependence of the specific heat of a nodal superconductor is lowered over a region of the phase diagram near topological transitions where nodal lines form or reconnect. Our idea is that the resulting enhancement of the low-temperature specific heat could have a potential application in the prevention of superconductor quenches. We perform numerical simulations of a simplified superconductor quench model. Results show that decreasing the specific heat exponent can prevent a quench from occurring and improve quench resilience, though in our simple model the effects are small.

A mathematical model developed from the measurement campaign was used to generate measured data for four years of rainfall. Annual cumulative distribution functions of SST prediction results are compared with the results of the measurement-based model. The results show SST to be a fair approximation of actual measurements. This was established by error analysis carried out to compare the error margins in SST prediction and the error margins in the in-force ITU-R prediction method. While the SST approach was shown to conform slightly less accurately to measurements than the ITU-R model, it still yields highly acceptable results in the 0 to 11 dB margin in which the said link experiences most of the measured attenuation before total channel squelching occurs.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2018.8538336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8538336","Synthetic Storm Technique;slant path rain attenuation;subtropical rain","Rain;Attenuation;Attenuation measurement;Storms;Mathematical model;Loss measurement;Satellite broadcasting","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Despite using the term “extreme,” such relatively large or small values of conductivity, permittivity, permeability, wavenumber, intrinsic impedance, and other electrical parameters are commonly observed in natural cases. Computational electromagnetic solvers adapt themselves to handle challenging cases by replacing exact models with approximate models, while minimizing the modeling error due to these transformations. For example, most metals with high conductivity values are assumed to be perfectly conducting, especially if the considered structure is comparable to the wavelength. This is very common for practical devices, such as antennas, metamaterials, filters, etc., at radio and microwave frequencies. In some cases — e.g., when the overall structure is small in terms of a wavelength — even a full-wave solver may not be required to analyze the underlying phenomena. Examples are circuit theory based on lumped elements and transmission-line modeling. On the other side, penetrable models are commonly used to represent dielectric and magnetic materials, when their electrical parameters (specifically, permittivity and permeability) have numerically “reasonable” values that facilitate their full-wave solutions without a fundamental issue. As the electrical parameters become extreme and other conditions (sizes, excitations, geometric properties) are satisfied, numerical approximations may again become useful, leading to the well-known implementations such as those based on impedance boundary conditions and physical optics.","1024-4530","","10.23919/URSIRSB.2018.8572603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8572603","","Permittivity;Plasmons;Integral equations;Surface impedance;Magnetic resonance imaging;Optical surface waves;Scattering","","","","17","","13 Dec 2018","","","URSI","URSI Journals"

Then, an example of magneto-static problem is considered for a ribbon magnetic core built sheet by sheet as well as corners taken into consideration. Conventional FEM and MsFEM are used to compute the magneto-static field by adopting scalar magnetic potential. Both magnetic potential and magnetic flux density on a certain path are compared. It is shown that the results obtained by MsFEM agree well with the one from conventional FEM.

Besides the reported traditional mode coupling, double anticrossing coupling involving two plasmonic modes and one photonic mode is achieved in a single cavity for the first time. Also, Q factors and field distributions of coupled modes are calculated, manifesting that the coupled modes are the high Q factor hybrid modes.

Finally, to further validate the findings, this paper aims at the prediction of different levels of attention function based on the attention score obtained from repeatable battery for the assessment of neurophysiological status (RBANS). Design/methodology/approach – The present paper analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded by a single prefrontal channel from 105 elderly subjects while they were responding to Stroop color test which is an attention-demanded task. Beside Stroop test, subjects also performed RBANS which provides their level of functionality in different domains including attention. After data acquisition (EEG during Stroop test and RBANS attention score), the authors extract the spectral features of EEG as neural indexes of attention and subjects' reaction time in response to Stroop test as behavioral index of attention. Then, they explore the correlation between these post-cue frequency band oscillations of EEG with elderly response time (RT). Next, the authors exploit these findings to classify RBANS attention score. Findings – The observations of this study suggest that there is significant negative correlation between alpha gamma ratio (AGR) and RT ($p < 0.0001$), theta beta ratio (TBR) is positively correlated with subjects' RT ($p < 0.0001$), these correlations are stronger in a 500ms period right after triggering the cue (question onset in Stroop test), and 4) TBR and AGR can be effectively used to predict RBANS attention score. Research limitations/implications – Because of the experiment design, the pre-cue EEG of the next trail was very much overlapped with the post-cue EEG of the current trail. Therefore, the authors could analyze only post-cue EEG. In future study, it would be interesting to investigate the predictability of subject's future performance from pre-cue EEG and mental preparation. Practical implications – This study provides an insight into the research on detection of human attention level from EEG instead of conventional neurophysiological tests. It has also potential to be used in implementation of feasible and efficient EEG-based brain computer interface training systems for elderly. Originality/value – To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is among very few attempts for early prediction of cognitive decline in the domain of attention from brain activity (EEG) instead of conventional tests which are prone to human errors.","2398-7294","","10.1108/IJCS-09-2018-0022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9826649","Elderly;Spectral analysis;EEG;Attention;Brain-computer interface;RBANS","Training;Brain;Time-frequency analysis;Correlation;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Behavioral sciences","","","","21","","11 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper we present the formulation of our novel hybrid algorithm, SAM, and the main results. The algorithm SAM, which stands for Simulated Annealing with Metropolis-Hastings, is a two-step process. To initialise, the search space of possible feasible schedules is divided into a number of sections. In the first step Metropolis-Hastings sampling is performed over the sections in order to obtain characteristics of a likelihood function over the sections so that a section with a high likelihood of containing the optimal schedule is chosen for step two. In step two SA is run on the pruned search space to find a solution schedule. This relies on a novel way of visualising the search space in a geometric way as a wheel of indices. The results show that low deviation solutions can be obtained in significantly shorter runs with SAM than seen in the literature or required of the basic SA algorithm. We can achieve a 4.5 times reduction in required algorithm run time to achieve a less than 2% deviation from the optimum value. SAM even enables us to find the optimal solution in as few as 1000 iterations of SA in some cases.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2018.8531800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531800","Simulated Annealing;scheduling;single-machine;earliness-tardiness;multi-objective;MCMC;Metropolis-Hastings;meta-heuristic","Single machine scheduling;Optimal scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Search problems;Simulated annealing;Task analysis","","","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Bifurcation theory is used to analyze fault tolerant ability of the system and the simulation results show that the new system has a much higher fault tolerant ability than the conventional multiplexing based on NAND gates.

Different numbers of intermediate nodes in wireless broadcast trees may exert great impacts on the energy consumption of individual nodes, which are typically equipped with a limited power supply in a wireless sensor network; this limitation may eventually determine how long the given wireless sensor network can last. Thus, obtaining a deep understanding of the mathematical nature of wireless broadcast trees is of great importance. In this paper, we give new proof of Cayley's well-known theorem for counting labeled trees. A distinct feature of this proof is that we purely use combinatorial structures instead of constructing a bijection between two kinds of labeled trees, which is in contrast to all existing proofs. Another contribution of this work is the presentation of a new theorem on trees based on the number of intermediate nodes in the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present a tree enumeration theorem based on the number of intermediate nodes in the tree.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2018.9010040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400425","energy efficiency;tree theorem;broadcast trees;wireless transmissions","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Ad hoc networks;Data structures;Information theory;Energy consumption;Power supplies","","","","","","2 Jul 2018","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

A free spectral range (FSR) in the N × N cyclic AWG is N channel spacing between two adjacent DWDM channels for each port pair. Planning every two-port pairs of the AWG is to effectively allocate the FSR for allowing the input of N /2 separates the groups of DWDM channels. In this way, the DWDM channels in N /2 groups can be demultiplexed into output ports of the AWG with intervals of two channel spacings. A multiple tunable FBGs can be used to reflect the DWDM channels into one output port of the 2 × 2 OXC or be tuned into the interval of the FSR to make the DWDM channels pass through directly into the other output port.

To improve the robustness of control system against the model errors and to reduce the computational burden, an optimal feedback based tracking control law is developed. The control scheme presented in this paper determines the amplitude and the reversals of bank angle respectively in the longitudinal and lateral flight plane. At each control cycle, the amplitude of the bank angle is obtained by an optimal feedback controller to minimize tracking errors. The control gains are tuned according to the closed-loop error dynamics by using optimization methods. The bank reversals are executed if the crossrange exceeds a predetermined corridor which is designed by setting a boundary function. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed closed-loop optimal feedback based control law in tracking the reference trajectory is verified via 500 deviation simulations, in which modeling errors and external disturbances are considered.","1004-4132","","10.21629/JSEE.2018.01.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320412","optimal control;feedback gains;Mars entry;trajectory tracking;Pontryagin's minimum principle","Trajectory;Trajectory tracking;Robustness;Vehicle dynamics;Acceleration;Feedback control;Process control","","","","","","22 Mar 2018","","","BIAI","BIAI Journals"

Indeed, the use of trusted computing is an enabling technology over nearly all ‘cyber’ areas: secure supply chain management, privacy and critical data protection, data sovereignty, cyber defence, legal etc. To achieve this generalization, we must fundamentally redefine what we mean by trusted and high-integrity computing. We are required to go beyond the boot-time trust and rethink notions of run-time trust, partial trust, how systems are constructed, the trust between management and operations, compute and storage infrastructure and the dynamic provisioning of services by external parties.

The effects of laser phase noise and noise from an acousto-optic frequency shifter (AOFS) on the dual-frequency laser phase-shift range finder are analyzed. Expressions of the power spectral density and the phase noise of the dual-frequency laser beat note are deduced. In addition, we find that noise from the AOFS has a considerable impact on beat note noise conversion. The theoretical results can be used to estimate the influence of laser phase noise, noise induced by the AOFS and delay length in the dual-frequency laser range finder. An experiment involving the dual-frequency laser range finder is performed on outdoor targets at a distance of 200 m, and the phase jitter observed in the experiment is in good agreement with the model of beat note phase noise.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2787687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241783","Remote sensing and sensors;optoelectronics.","Laser noise;Phase noise;Laser theory;Fiber lasers;Power lasers;Laser modes;Optical interferometry","","","","23","OAPA","29 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of active devices has an inverse functionality of transistors and is suggested to be called trancitor rather than transistor, because it directly transfers an input signal into a voltage output. It is expected that a trancitor coupled with a transistor can provide a minimal circuit configuration, i.e., low circuit complexity, helping virtually to meet Moore’s law. In addition, this may also lead to a lower power consumption and higher speed of circuits compared with a transistor-only circuit. These are supported with a circuit simulation and simple Tetris-like block analysis. In this regard, in the future, it should be required to find a trancitor to be another foundation of electronics along with transistors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866883","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2018R1C1B6001688); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444611","Beyond CMOS transistors;new device concept;trancitor;inverse of transistors;active devices;semiconductor devices;electronics;Moore’s law","Complexity theory;MOSFET;Resistors;Voltage control;Semiconductor device modeling;Integrated circuit modeling","","","","18","CCBY","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It combines a fully direct probabilistic model (minimizing a photometric error) with consistent, joint optimization of all model parameters, including geometry-represented as inverse depth in a reference frame-and camera motion. This is achieved in real time by omitting the smoothness prior used in other direct methods and instead sampling pixels evenly throughout the images. Since our method does not depend on keypoint detectors or descriptors, it can naturally sample pixels from across all image regions that have intensity gradient, including edges or smooth intensity variations on essentially featureless walls. The proposed model integrates a full photometric calibration, accounting for exposure time, lens vignetting, and non-linear response functions. We thoroughly evaluate our method on three different datasets comprising several hours of video.

In the field of computer vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios.

Millions of sensors and devices are continuously producing data and exchanging important messages via complex networks supporting machine-to-machine communications and monitoring and controlling critical smart-world infrastructures. As a strategy to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion, edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve IoT and localized computing needs. Compared with the well-known cloud computing, edge computing will migrate data computation or storage to the network “edge”, near the end users. Thus, a number of computation nodes distributed across the network can offload the computational stress away from the centralized data center, and can significantly reduce the latency in message exchange. In addition, the distributed structure can balance network traffic and avoid the traffic peaks in IoT networks, reducing the transmission latency between edge/cloudlet servers and end users, as well as reducing response times for real-time IoT applications in comparison with traditional cloud services. Furthermore, by transferring computation and communication overhead from nodes with limited battery supply to nodes with significant power resources, the system can extend the lifetime of the individual nodes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey, analyzing how edge computing improves the performance of IoT networks. We categorize edge computing into different groups based on architecture, and study their performance by comparing network latency, bandwidth occupation, energy consumption, and overhead. In addition, we consider security issues in edge computing, evaluating the availability, integrity, and the confidentiality of security strategies of each group, and propose a framework for security evaluation of IoT networks with edge computing. Finally, we compare the performance of various IoT applications (smart city, smart grid, smart transportation, and so on) in edge computing and traditional cloud computing architectures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2778504","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1350145); University System of Maryland Wilson H.

However, it is impractical for traditional kNN methods to assign a fixed k value (even though set by experts) to all test samples. Previous solutions assign different k values to different test samples by the cross validation method but are usually time-consuming. This paper proposes a kTree method to learn different optimal k values for different test/new samples, by involving a training stage in the kNN classification. Specifically, in the training stage, kTree method first learns optimal k values for all training samples by a new sparse reconstruction model, and then constructs a decision tree (namely, kTree) using training samples and the learned optimal k values. In the test stage, the kTree fast outputs the optimal k value for each test sample, and then, the kNN classification can be conducted using the learned optimal k value and all training samples. As a result, the proposed kTree method has a similar running cost but higher classification accuracy, compared with traditional kNN methods, which assign a fixed k value to all test samples. Moreover, the proposed kTree method needs less running cost but achieves similar classification accuracy, compared with the newly kNN methods, which assign different k values to different test samples. This paper further proposes an improvement version of kTree method (namely, k*Tree method) to speed its test stage by extra storing the information of the training samples in the leaf nodes of kTree, such as the training samples located in the leaf nodes, their kNNs, and the nearest neighbor of these kNNs. We call the resulting decision tree as k*Tree, which enables to conduct kNN classification using a subset of the training samples in the leaf nodes rather than all training samples used in the newly","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2673241","China “1000-Plan” National Distinguished Professorship; Nation Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61263035,61573270,61672177); China 973 Program(grant numbers:2013CB329404); China Key Research Program(grant numbers:2016YFB1000905); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015GXNSFCB139011); Research Fund of Guangxi Key Lab of MIMS (16-A-01-01 and 16-A-01-02); Guangxi High Institutions’ Program of Introducing 100 High-Level Overseas Talents; Guangxi Collaborative Innovation Center of Multi-Source Information Integration and Intelligent Processing; Guangxi “Bagui” Teams for Innovation and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7898482","Decision tree;k nearest neighbor (kNN) classification;sparse coding","Training;Decision trees;Data mining;Predictive models;Learning systems;Technological innovation;Optics","","869","","68","OAPA","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we show that when each 2-D image frame is reconstructed independently, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2-D compressed sensing approaches, such as dictionary learning-based MR image reconstruction, in terms of reconstruction error and reconstruction speed. Second, when reconstructing the frames of the sequences jointly, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn spatio-temporal correlations efficiently by combining convolution and data sharing approaches. We show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is capable of preserving anatomical structure more faithfully up to 11-fold undersampling.

The two images to fusion, as well as their associated weight maps, are defined to promote the transfer of edges and color contrast to the output image. To avoid that the sharp weight map transitions create artifacts in the low frequency components of the reconstructed image, we also adapt a multiscale fusion strategy. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation reveals that our enhanced images and videos are characterized by better exposedness of the dark regions, improved global contrast, and edges sharpness.

The distance between the cloud and the end devices might be an issue for latency-sensitive applications such as disaster management and content delivery applications. Service level agreements (SLAs) may also impose processing at locations where the cloud provider does not have data centers. Fog computing is a novel paradigm to address such issues. It enables provisioning resources and services outside the cloud, at the edge of the network, closer to end devices, or eventually, at locations stipulated by SLAs.

This can not only reduce the scanning cost and ease patient burden, but also potentially reduce motion artefacts and the effect of contrast washout, thus yielding better image quality. Different from parallel imaging-based fast MRI, which utilizes multiple coils to simultaneously receive MR signals, CS-MRI breaks the Nyquist-Shannon sampling barrier to reconstruct MRI images with much less required raw data. This paper provides a deep learning-based strategy for reconstruction of CS-MRI, and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning methods working only on data from a single image, and prior knowledge from large training data sets. In particular, a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-based model (DAGAN)-based model is proposed to reconstruct CS-MRI. In our DAGAN architecture, we have designed a refinement learning method to stabilize our U-Net based generator, which provides an end-to-end network to reduce aliasing artefacts. To better preserve texture and edges in the reconstruction, we have coupled the adversarial loss with an innovative content loss. In addition, we incorporate frequency-domain information to enforce similarity in both the image and frequency domains. We have performed comprehensive comparison studies with both conventional CS-MRI reconstruction methods and newly investigated deep learning approaches. Compared with these methods, our DAGAN method provides superior reconstruction with preserved perceptual image details. Furthermore, each image is reconstructed in about 5 ms, which is suitable for real-time processing.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2785879","British Heart Foundation Project Grant(grant numbers:PG/16/78/32402); NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit; Royal Brompton Hospital and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust; Jaywing plc; Optimise Portal; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8233175","Compressed sensing;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);fast MRI;deep learning;generative adversarial networks (GAN);de-aliasing;inverse problems","Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Acceleration;Transforms;Encoding","Algorithms;Data Compression;Deep Learning;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","715","","72","CCBY","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Service heterogeneity can be accommodated by network slicing, through which each service is allocated resources to provide performance guarantees and isolation from the other services. Slicing of the radio access network (RAN) is typically done by means of orthogonal resource allocation among the services. This paper studies the potential advantages of allowing for non-orthogonal sharing of RAN resources in uplink communications from a set of eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC devices to a common base station. The approach is referred to as heterogeneous nonorthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA), in contrast to the conventional NOMA techniques that involve users with homogeneous requirements and hence can be investigated through a standard multiple access channel. The study devises a communication-theoretic model that accounts for the heterogeneous requirements and characteristics of the three services. The concept of reliability diversity is introduced as a design principle that leverages the different reliability requirements across the services in order to ensure performance guarantees with non-orthogonal RAN slicing. This paper reveals that H-NOMA can lead, in some regimes, to significant gains in terms of performance tradeoffs among the three generic services as compared to orthogonal slicing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872781","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program through the following grants: ERC Consolidator(grant numbers:648382); WILLOW; H2020 European Research Council(grant numbers:725731); FOGHORN; Vetenskapsrådet(grant numbers:2016-03293); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476595","5G mobile communication;machine-to-machine communications;multiaccess communication;NOMA;wireless communication","NOMA;Reliability;Wireless communication;Resource management;Radio spectrum management;Time-frequency analysis;5G mobile communication","","661","","16","OAPA","28 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Over the past decade, researchers have demonstrated the possibilities to automate the initial lesion detection. However, the lack of a common dataset impedes research when comparing the performance of such algorithms. This paper proposes the use of deep learning approaches for breast ultrasound lesion detection and investigates three different methods: a Patch-based LeNet, a U-Net, and a transfer learning approach with a pretrained FCN-AlexNet. Their performance is compared against four state-of-the-art lesion detection algorithms (i.e., Radial Gradient Index, Multifractal Filtering, Rule-based Region Ranking, and Deformable Part Models). In addition, this paper compares and contrasts two conventional ultrasound image datasets acquired from two different ultrasound systems.

The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is considered the best among all battery types and cells because of its superior characteristics and performance. The positive environmental impacts and recycling potential of lithium batteries have influenced the development of new research for improving Li-ion battery technologies. However, the cost reduction, safe operation, and mitigation of negative ecological impacts are now a common concern for advancement. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the state of the art of Li-ion batteries including the fundamentals, structures, and overall performance evaluations of different types of lithium batteries. A study on a battery management system for Li-ion battery storage in EV applications is demonstrated, which includes a cell condition monitoring, charge, and discharge control, states estimation, protection and equalization, temperature control and heat management, battery fault diagnosis, and assessment aimed at enhancing the overall performance of the system. It is observed that the Li-ion batteries are becoming very popular in vehicle applications due to price reductions and lightweight with high power density. However, the management of the charging and discharging processes, CO2 and greenhouse gases emissions, health effects, and recycling and refurbishing processes have still not been resolved satisfactorily. Consequently, this review focuses on the many factors, challenges, and problems and provides recommendations for sustainable battery manufacturing for future EVs. This review will hopefully lead to increasing efforts toward the development of an advanced Li-ion battery in terms of economics, longevity, specific power, energy density, safety, and performance in vehicle applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817655","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia(grant numbers:DIP-2015-012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8320763","Lithium-ion battery;state-of-the-art of lithium-ion battery;energy management system;electric vehicle","Lithium-ion batteries;Lithium;Cathodes;Ions;Anodes;Electrolytes","","637","","117","OAPA","21 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the subjective nature of this problem, most existing methods only predict the mean opinion score provided by data sets, such as AVA and TID2013. Our approach differs from others in that we predict the distribution of human opinion scores using a convolutional neural network. Our architecture also has the advantage of being significantly simpler than other methods with comparable performance. Our proposed approach relies on the success (and retraining) of proven, state-of-the-art deep object recognition networks. Our resulting network can be used to not only score images reliably and with high correlation to human perception, but also to assist with adaptation and optimization of photo editing/enhancement algorithms in a photographic pipeline. All this is done without need for a “golden” reference image, consequently allowing for single-image, semantic- and perceptually-aware, no-reference quality assessment.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2018.2831899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8352823","Image quality assessment;no-reference quality assessment;deep learning","Standards;Quality assessment;Image quality;Distortion;Histograms;Training;Task analysis","","623","","47","CCBY","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the batteries, with strong time-variables and nonlinear characteristics, are further influenced by such random factors such as driving loads, operational conditions, in the application of EVs. The real-time, accurate estimation of their state is challenging.

Based on the derived waveforms, we further consider weighted optimizations targeting a flexible tradeoff between radar and communications performance and introduce low-complexity algorithms. Moreover, to address the more practical constant modulus waveform design problem, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm that obtains a globally optimal solution, and derive its worst-case complexity as function of the maximum iteration number.

However, they have not demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes (a.k.a. zero-shot learning). To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based interactive segmentation framework by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine tuning to make a CNN model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised (without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and interaction-based uncertainty for the fine tuning. We applied this framework to two applications: 2-D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal magnetic resonance (MR) slices, where only two types of these organs were annotated for training and 3-D segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor (including edema) from different MR sequences, where only the tumor core in one MR sequence was annotated for training. Experimental results show that: 1) our model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art CNNs; 2) image-specific fine tuning with the proposed weighted loss function significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than traditional interactive segmentation methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2018.2791721","Wellcome Trust(grant numbers:WT101957,WT97914,HICF-T4-275); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:NS/A000027/1,EP/H046410/1,EP/J020990/1,EP/K005278,NS/A000050/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:203145Z/16/Z); Royal Society(grant numbers:RG160569); University College London; Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity; University College London; Nvidia; Emerald, a GPU-accelerated High Performance Computer, made available by the Science and Engineering South Consortium operated in partnership with the STFC Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8270673","Interactive image segmentation;convolutional neural network;fine-tuning;fetal MRI;brain tumor","Image segmentation;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Biomedical imaging;Two dimensional displays;Adaptation models;Testing","Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Deep Learning;Female;Fetus;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pregnancy;Prenatal Diagnosis","579","","37","CCBY","26 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two operational options are considered, where we first split the antennas into two groups, one for radar and the other for communication. Under this deployment, the radar signal is designed to fall into the null-space of the downlink channel. The communication beamformer is optimized such that the beampattern obtained matches the radar's beampattern while satisfying the communication performance requirements. To reduce the optimizations' constraints, we consider a second operational option, where all the antennas transmit a joint waveform that is shared by both radar and communications. In this case, we formulate an appropriate probing beampattern, while guaranteeing the performance of the downlink communications. By incorporating the SINR constraints into objective functions as penalty terms, we further simplify the original beamforming designs to weighted optimizations, and solve them by efficient manifold algorithms. Numerical results show that the shared deployment outperforms the separated case significantly, and the proposed weighted optimizations achieve a similar performance to the original optimizations, despite their significantly lower computational complexity.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2018.2803045","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/M014150/1); China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771047); European Research Council’s Advanced Fellow Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8288677","MU-MISO downlink;radar-communication co-existence;beampattern design;beamforming;Riemannian manifold","Radar;Radar antennas;Optimization;Downlink;Interference;Array signal processing;MIMO communication","","576","","44","CCBY","9 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Next, the sequential information among frame features is learnt using DB-LSTM network, where multiple layers are stacked together in both forward pass and backward pass of DB-LSTM to increase its depth. The proposed method is capable of learning long term sequences and can process lengthy videos by analyzing features for a certain time interval.

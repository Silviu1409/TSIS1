Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its ""neighbors."" In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.812781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1205192","","Autonomous agents;Nearest neighbor searches;Biological system modeling;Discrete event simulation;Lyapunov method;Convergence;Graphics;Linear systems;Control systems;Graph theory","","6861","10","36","IEEE","20 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body.

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238663","","Web pages;Lighting;Vector quantization;Image databases;Robots;Layout;Noise reduction;File systems;Object recognition;Visual databases","","4108","204","18","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many applications use only the items that customers purchase and explicitly rate to represent their interests, but they can also use other attributes, including items viewed, demographic data, subject interests, and favorite artists. At Amazon.com, we use recommendation algorithms to personalize the online store for each customer. The store radically changes based on customer interests, showing programming titles to a software engineer and baby toys to a new mother. There are three common approaches to solving the recommendation problem: traditional collaborative filtering, cluster models, and search-based methods. Here, we compare these methods with our algorithm, which we call item-to-item collaborative filtering. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering, our algorithm's online computation scales independently of the number of customers and number of items in the product catalog. Our algorithm produces recommendations in real-time, scales to massive data sets, and generates high quality recommendations.","1941-0131","","10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167344","","Collaboration;Clustering algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Aggregates;Information filtering;Information filters;Demography;Pediatrics;Electronic mail;Advertising","","3769","156","10","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The protocols exploit spatial diversity available among a collection of distributed terminals that relay messages for one another in such a manner that the destination terminal can average the fading, even though it is unknown a priori which terminals will be involved. In particular, a source initiates transmission to its destination, and many relays potentially receive the transmission. Those terminals that can fully decode the transmission utilize a space-time code to cooperatively relay to the destination. We demonstrate that these protocols achieve full spatial diversity in the number of cooperating terminals, not just the number of decoding relays, and can be used effectively for higher spectral efficiencies than repetition-based schemes. We discuss issues related to space-time code design for these protocols, emphasizing codes that readily allow for appealing distributed versions.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237130","","Wireless application protocol;Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Diversity reception;Relays;Signal processing algorithms;Fading;Decoding;Bandwidth;Antenna arrays","","3241","41","16","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Allowing a node to encode its received data before passing it on, the question involves optimization of the multicast mechanisms at the nodes. Among the simplest coding schemes is linear coding, which regards a block of data as a vector over a certain base field and allows a node to apply a linear transformation to a vector before passing it on.

"Super-resolution image reconstruction: a technical overview","Sung Cheol Park; Min Kyu Park; Moon Gi Kang",NA; NA; NA,IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,"11 Jun 2003","2003","20","3","21","36","A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term ""SR image reconstruction"" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term ""super"" in ""super resolution"" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2003.1203207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203207","","Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Signal resolution;Strontium;Spatial resolution;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Optical signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Biomedical optical imaging","","2510","254","79","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

"On the achievable throughput of a multiantenna Gaussian broadcast channel","G. Caire; S. Shamai","EURECOM, France; NA",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"25 Jun 2003","2003","49","7","1691","1706","A Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) with r single-antenna receivers and t antennas at the transmitter is considered. Both transmitter and receivers have perfect knowledge of the channel. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model is, in general, a nondegraded broadcast channel (BC), for which the capacity region is not fully known. For the two-user case, we find a special case of Marton's (1979) region that achieves optimal sum-rate (throughput). In brief, the transmitter decomposes the channel into two interference channels, where interference is caused by the other user signal. Users are successively encoded, such that encoding of the second user is based on the noncausal knowledge of the interference caused by the first user. The crosstalk parameters are optimized such that the overall throughput is maximum and, surprisingly, this is shown to be optimal over all possible strategies (not only with respect to Marton's achievable region). For the case of r>2 users, we find a somewhat simpler choice of Marton's region based on ordering and successively encoding the users. For each user i in the given ordering, the interference caused by users j>i is eliminated by zero forcing at the transmitter, while interference caused by users j<i is taken into account by coding for noncausally known interference. Under certain mild conditions, this scheme is found to be throughput-wise asymptotically optimal for both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We conclude by providing some numerical results for the ergodic throughput of the simplified zero-forcing scheme in independent Rayleigh fading.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.813523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207369","","Throughput;Broadcasting;Transmitters;Interference elimination;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Interference channels;Crosstalk;Signal to noise ratio;Rayleigh channels","","1875","89","57","IEEE","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Multitarget Bayes filtering via first-order multitarget moments","R. P. S.

Even in single-target problems, this optimal filter is so computationally challenging that it must usually be approximated. Consequently, multitarget Bayes filtering will never be of practical interest without the development of drastic but principled approximation strategies. In single-target problems, the computationally fastest approximate filtering approach is the constant-gain Kalman filter. This filter propagates a first-order statistical moment - the posterior expectation - in the place of the posterior distribution. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analogous strategy for multitarget systems: propagation of a first-order statistical moment of the multitarget posterior. This moment, the probability hypothesis density (PHD), is the function whose integral in any region of state space is the expected number of targets in that region. We derive recursive Bayes filter equations for the PHD that account for multiple sensors, nonconstant probability of detection, Poisson false alarms, and appearance, spawning, and disappearance of targets. We also show that the PHD is a best-fit approximation of the multitarget posterior in an information-theoretic sense.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1261119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261119","","Filtering;Sensor systems;State-space methods;Virtual colonoscopy;Probability;Density measurement;Random number generation;Nonlinear filters;Terrorism;Contracts","","1830","3","70","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, knowledge of the channel is often obtained by sending known training symbols to the receiver. We show how training affects the capacity of a fading channel-too little training and the channel is improperly learned, too much training and there is no time left for data transmission before the channel changes. We compute a lower bound on the capacity of a channel that is learned by training, and maximize the bound as a function of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fading coherence time, and number of transmitter antennas. When the training and data powers are allowed to vary, we show that the optimal number of training symbols is equal to the number of transmit antennas-this number is also the smallest training interval length that guarantees meaningful estimates of the channel matrix. When the training and data powers are instead required to be equal, the optimal number of symbols may be larger than the number of antennas. We show that training-based schemes can be optimal at high SNR, but suboptimal at low SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.809594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193803","","Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Wireless communication;Fading;Error probability;Channel capacity;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitters;Data communication;Throughput","","1777","39","21","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The latter modulates the local variance of the coefficients in the neighborhood, and is thus able to account for the empirically observed correlation between the coefficient amplitudes. Under this model, the Bayesian least squares estimate of each coefficient reduces to a weighted average of the local linear estimates over all possible values of the hidden multiplier variable.

Although enormous capacity gains have been predicted for such channels, these predictions are based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions about the underlying time-varying channel model and how well it can be tracked at the receiver, as well as at the transmitter. More realistic assumptions can dramatically impact the potential capacity gains of MIMO techniques. For time-varying MIMO channels there are multiple Shannon theoretic capacity definitions and, for each definition, different correlation models and channel information assumptions that we consider. We first provide a comprehensive summary of ergodic and capacity versus outage results for single-user MIMO channels. These results indicate that the capacity gain obtained from multiple antennas heavily depends on the available channel information at either the receiver or transmitter, the channel signal-to-noise ratio, and the correlation between the channel gains on each antenna element. We then focus attention on the capacity region of the multiple-access channels (MACs) and the largest known achievable rate region for the broadcast channel. In contrast to single-user MIMO channels, capacity results for these multiuser MIMO channels are quite difficult to obtain, even for constant channels. We summarize results for the MIMO broadcast and MAC for channels that are either constant or fading with perfect instantaneous knowledge of the antenna gains at both transmitter(s) and receiver(s). We show that the capacity region of the MIMO multiple access and the largest known achievable rate region (called the dirty-paper region) for the MIMO broadcast channel are intimately related via a duality transformation. This transformation facilitates finding the transmission strategies that achieve a point on the boundary of the MIMO MAC capacity region in terms of the transmission strategies of the MIMO broadcast dirty-paper region and vice-versa. Finally, we discuss capacity results for multicell MIMO channels with base station cooperation. The base stations then act as a spatially diverse antenna array and transmission strategies that exploit this structure exhibit significant capacity gains. This section also provides a brief discussion of system level issues associated with MIMO cellular. Open problems in this field abound and are discussed throughout the paper.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203154","","MIMO;Transmitting antennas;Broadcasting;Receiving antennas;Channel capacity;Transmitters;Base stations;Time-varying channels;Predictive models;Signal to noise ratio","","1716","61","89","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Combining iterative processing with multiple-antenna channels is particularly challenging because the channel capacities can be a factor of ten or more higher than their single-antenna counterparts. Using a ""list"" version of the sphere decoder, we provide a simple method to iteratively detect and decode any linear space-time mapping combined with any channel code that can be decoded using so-called ""soft"" inputs and outputs. We exemplify our technique by directly transmitting symbols that are coded with a channel code; we show that iterative processing with even this simple scheme can achieve near-capacity.

After reviewing conventional methods of ZMP based pattern generation, we formalize the problem as the design of a ZMP tracking servo controller. It is shown that we can realize such controller by adopting the preview control theory that uses the future reference. It is also shown that a preview controller can be used to compensate the ZMP error caused by the difference between a simple model and the precise multibody model.

The surface used in this report is, more specifically, an electrode covered with dielectrics, hence, called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). All the fluidic movement is confined between two plates, which we call parallel-plate channel, rather than through closed channels or on open surfaces. While transporting and merging droplets are easily verified, we discover that there exists a design criterion for a given set of materials beyond which the droplet simply cannot be cut by EWOD mechanism. The condition for successful cutting is theoretically analyzed by examining the channel gap, the droplet size and the degree of contact angle change by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD). A series of experiments is run and verifies the criterion.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2002.807467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183744","","Merging;Microfluidics;Circuits;Dielectric liquids;Surface tension;Lab-on-a-chip;Electric potential;Electrodes;Micromechanical devices;Moon","","1275","81","29","IEEE","28 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under bad weather conditions, the light reaching a camera is severely scattered by the atmosphere. The resulting decay in contrast varies across the scene and is exponential in the depths of scene points. Therefore, traditional space invariant image processing techniques are not sufficient to remove weather effects from images. We present a physics-based model that describes the appearances of scenes in uniform bad weather conditions. Changes in intensities of scene points under different weather conditions provide simple constraints to detect depth discontinuities in the scene and also to compute scene structure. Then, a fast algorithm to restore scene contrast is presented. In contrast to previous techniques, our weather removal algorithm does not require any a priori scene structure, distributions of scene reflectances, or detailed knowledge about the particular weather condition. All the methods described in this paper are effective under a wide range of weather conditions including haze, mist, fog, and conditions arising due to other aerosols. Further, our methods can be applied to gray scale, RGB color, multispectral and even IR images. We also extend our techniques to restore contrast of scenes with moving objects, captured using a video camera.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1201821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201821","","Image restoration;Degradation;Layout;Light scattering;Atmosphere;Atmospheric modeling;Optical scattering;Painting;Optical polarization;Cameras","","1273","22","38","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, if the desired signal is present in training snapshots, the adaptive array performance may be quite sensitive even to slight mismatches between the presumed and actual signal steering vectors (spatial signatures). Such mismatches can occur as a result of environmental nonstationarities, look direction errors, imperfect array calibration, distorted antenna shape, as well as distortions caused by medium inhomogeneities, near-far mismatch, source spreading, and local scattering. The similar type of performance degradation can occur when the signal steering vector is known exactly but the training sample size is small. In this paper, we develop a new approach to robust adaptive beamforming in the presence of an arbitrary unknown signal steering vector mismatch. Our approach is based on the optimization of worst-case performance. It turns out that the natural formulation of this adaptive beamforming problem involves minimization of a quadratic function subject to infinitely many nonconvex quadratic constraints. We show that this (originally intractable) problem can be reformulated in a convex form as the so-called second-order cone (SOC) program and solved efficiently (in polynomial time) using the well-established interior point method. It is also shown that the proposed technique can be interpreted in terms of diagonal loading where the optimal value of the diagonal loading factor is computed based on the known level of uncertainty of the signal steering vector. Computer simulations with several frequently encountered types of signal steering vector mismatches show better performance of our robust beamformer as compared with existing adaptive beamforming algorithms.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2002.806865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166614","","Robustness;Array signal processing;Optimization;Sensor arrays;Degradation;Adaptive arrays;Antenna arrays;Calibration;Directive antennas;Shape","","1193","6","39","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a quantized maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) beamforming technique is proposed where the receiver only sends the label of the best beamforming vector in a predetermined codebook to the transmitter. By using the distribution of the optimal beamforming vector in independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading matrix channels, the codebook design problem is solved and related to the problem of Grassmannian line packing. The proposed design criterion is flexible enough to allow for side constraints on the codebook vectors. Bounds on the codebook size are derived to guarantee full diversity order. Results on the density of Grassmannian line packings are derived and used to develop bounds on the codebook size given a capacity or SNR loss.

They both exhibit identical diversity orders, but their coding gains in decibels differ by a constant. The diversity and coding gains are found to depend on the behavior of-the random SNR's probability density function only at the origin, or equivalently, on the decaying order of the corresponding moment generating function (i.e., how fast the moment generating function goes to zero as its argument goes to infinity). Diversity and coding gains for diversity combining systems are expressed in terms of the diversity branches' individual diversity and coding gains, where the branches can come from any diversity technique such as space, time, frequency, or, multipath. The proposed analysis offers a simple and unifying approach to evaluating the performance of uncoded and (possibly space-time) coded transmissions over fading channels, and the method applies to almost all digital modulation schemes, including M-ary phaseshift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, and frequency-shift keying with coherent or noncoherent detection.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.815053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221802","","Fading;Diversity reception;Signal to noise ratio;Probability density function;H infinity control;Frequency diversity;Performance analysis;Digital modulation;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Frequency shift keying","","1164","6","15","IEEE","18 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a mushroom-like EBG structure is analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Its band-gap feature of surface-wave suppression is demonstrated by exhibiting the near field distributions of the electromagnetic waves. The mutual coupling of microstrip antennas is parametrically investigated, including both the E and H coupling directions, different substrate thickness, and various dielectric constants. It is observed that the E-plane coupled microstrip antenna array on a thick and high permittivity substrate has a strong mutual coupling due to the pronounced surface waves. Therefore, an EBG structure is inserted between array elements to reduce the mutual coupling. This idea has been verified by both the FDTD simulations and experimental results. As a result, a significant 8 dB mutual coupling reduction is noticed from the measurements.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236116","","Microstrip antenna arrays;Microstrip antennas;Periodic structures;Metamaterials;Mutual coupling;Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Surface waves;Dielectric substrates;Photonic band gap","","1135","47","46","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Diagonal loading (including its extended versions) has been a popular approach to improve the robustness of the Capon beamformer. We show that a natural extension of the Capon beamformer to the case of uncertain steering vectors also belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the amount of diagonal loading can be precisely calculated based on the uncertainty set of the steering vector.

We generally formulate the data rate maximization problem by allowing that a subcarrier could be shared by multiple users. The transmit power adaptation scheme is derived by solving the maximization problem via two steps: subcarrier assignment for users and power allocation for subcarriers. We have found that the data rate of a multiuser OFDM system is maximized when each subcarrier is assigned to only one user with the best channel gain for that subcarrier and the transmit power is distributed over the subcarriers by the water-filling policy. In order to reduce the computational complexity in calculating water-filling level in the proposed transmit power adaptation method, we also propose a simple method where users with the best channel gain for each subcarrier are selected and then the transmit power is equally distributed among the subcarriers. Results show that the total data rate for the proposed transmit power adaptation methods significantly increases with the number of users owing to the multiuser diversity effects and is greater than that for the conventional frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)-like transmit power adaptation schemes. Furthermore, we have found that the total data rate of the multiuser OFDM system with the proposed transmit power adaptation methods becomes even higher than the capacity of the AWGN channel when the number of users is large enough.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.807348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177182","","OFDM;Frequency domain analysis;Intersymbol interference;Downlink;Data communication;Delay;Fading;Computational complexity;Frequency diversity;AWGN channels","","1067","11","13","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This task of estimating camera motion from measurements of a continuously expanding set of self-mapped visual features is one of a class of problems known as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) in the robotics community, and we argue that such real-time mapping research, despite rarely being camera-based, is more relevant here than off-line structure from motion methods due to the more fundamental emphasis placed on propagation of uncertainty. We present a top-down Bayesian framework for single-camera localisation via mapping of a sparse set of natural features using motion modelling and an information-guided active measurement strategy, in particular addressing the difficult issue of real-time feature initialisation via a factored sampling approach. Real-time handling of uncertainty permits robust localisation via the creating and active measurement of a sparse map of landmarks such that regions can be re-visited after periods of neglect and localisation can continue through periods when few features are visible.

Linearity over the field of real numbers facilitates the design of ML decoders using number-theoretic tools for searching the closest lattice point. These decoders are collectively referred to as sphere decoders in the literature. In this paper, a fresh look at this class of decoding algorithms is taken. In particular, two novel algorithms are developed. The first algorithm is inspired by the Pohst enumeration strategy and is shown to offer a significant reduction in complexity compared to the Viterbo-Boutros sphere decoder. The connection between the proposed algorithm and the stack sequential decoding algorithm is then established. This connection is utilized to construct the second algorithm which can also be viewed as an application of the Schnorr-Euchner strategy to ML decoding. Aided with a detailed study of preprocessing algorithms, a variant of the second algorithm is developed and shown to offer significant reductions in the computational complexity compared to all previously proposed sphere decoders with a near-ML detection performance. This claim is supported by intuitive arguments and simulation results in many relevant scenarios.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237128","","Maximum likelihood detection;Lattices;Maximum likelihood decoding;MIMO;Linearity;Detectors;Amplitude modulation;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Feedback","","991","56","42","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods.

Instead of considering each design criterion in a separate way, we generalize the existing results by developing a unified framework based on considering two families of objective functions that embrace most reasonable criteria to design a communication system: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. Once the optimal structure of the transmit-receive processing is known, the design problem simplifies and can be formulated within the powerful framework of convex optimization theory, in which a great number of interesting design criteria can be easily accommodated and efficiently solved, even though closed-form expressions may not exist. From this perspective, we analyze a variety of design criteria, and in particular, we derive optimal beamvectors in the sense of having minimum average bit error rate (BER). Additional constraints on the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) or on the signal dynamic range are easily included in the design. We propose two multilevel water-filling practical solutions that perform very close to the optimal in terms of average BER with a low implementation complexity. If cooperation among the processing operating at different carriers is allowed, the performance improves significantly. Interestingly, with carrier cooperation, it turns out that the exact optimal solution in terms of average BER can be obtained in closed form.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.815393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223549","","Array signal processing;MIMO;Design optimization;Bit error rate;Peak to average power ratio;Transmitters;Communication systems;Closed-form solution;Dynamic range;Signal design","","934","11","44","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, eigenspace transformation based on principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to time-varying distance signals derived from a sequence of silhouette images to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space. Supervised pattern classification techniques are finally performed in the lower-dimensional eigenspace for recognition. This method implicitly captures the structural and transitional characteristics of gait. Extensive experimental results on outdoor image sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an encouraging recognition performance with relatively low computational cost.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251144","","Humans;Image sequences;Principal component analysis;Computer vision;Algorithm design and analysis;Image segmentation;Legged locomotion;Pattern classification;Pattern recognition;Image recognition","","884","5","38","IEEE","8 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the dual-power-source nature of these vehicles, control strategies based on engineering intuition frequently fail to fully explore the potential of these advanced vehicles. In this paper, we present a procedure for the design of a near-optimal power management strategy. The design procedure starts by defining a cost function, such as minimizing a combination of fuel consumption and selected emission species over a driving cycle. Dynamic programming (DP) is then utilized to find the optimal control actions including the gear-shifting sequence and the power split between the engine and motor while subject to a battery SOC-sustaining constraint. Through analysis of the behavior of DP control actions, near-optimal rules are extracted, which, unlike DP control signals, are implementable. The performance of this power management control strategy is studied by using the hybrid vehicle model HE-VESIM developed at the Automotive Research Center of the University of Michigan. A tradeoff study between fuel economy and emissions was performed. It was found that significant emission reduction could be achieved at the expense of a small increase in fuel consumption.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2003.815606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255660","","Energy management;Land vehicles;Fuel economy;Automotive engineering;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving;Power engineering and energy;Intelligent vehicles;Cost function;Dynamic programming","","880","3","19","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Past approaches have built detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20/spl times/15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate. Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones.

One of the more effective and widely used methods for power-aware computing is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). In order to obtain the maximum power savings from DVS, it is essential to scale the supply voltage as low as possible while ensuring correct operation of the processor. The critical voltage is chosen such that under a worst-case scenario of process and environmental variations, the processor always operates correctly. However, this approach leads to a very conservative supply voltage since such a worst-case combination of different variabilities is very rare. In this paper, we propose a new approach to DVS, called Razor, based on dynamic detection and correction of circuit timing errors. The key idea of Razor is to tune the supply voltage by monitoring the error rate during circuit operation, thereby eliminating the need for voltage margins and exploiting the data dependence of circuit delay. A Razor flip-flop is introduced that double-samples pipeline stage values, once with a fast clock and again with a time-borrowing delayed clock. A metastability-tolerant comparator then validates latch values sampled with the fast clock. In the event of timing error, a modified pipeline mispeculation recovery mechanism restores correct program state. A prototype Razor pipeline was designed in a 0.18 /spl mu/m technology and was analyzed. Razor energy overhead during normal operation is limited to 3.1%. Analyses of a full-custom multiplier and a SPICE-level Kogge-Stone adder model reveal that substantial energy savings are possible for these devices (up to 64.2%) with little impact on performance due to error recovery (less than 3%).","","0-7695-2043-X","10.1109/MICRO.2003.1253179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253179","","Pipelines;Timing;Clocks;Dynamic voltage scaling;Voltage control;Error correction;Tuned circuits;Delay;Frequency;Silicon","","855","73","25","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points.

Regularization is achieved by promoting a reconstruction with low-complexity, expressed in the wavelet coefficients, taking advantage of the well known sparsity of wavelet representations. Previous works have investigated wavelet-based restoration but, except for certain special cases, the resulting criteria are solved approximately or require demanding optimization methods. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator obtained in the Fourier domain. Thus, it is a general-purpose approach to wavelet-based image restoration with computational complexity comparable to that of standard wavelet denoising schemes or of frequency domain deconvolution methods. The algorithm alternates between an E-step based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a DWT-based M-step, resulting in an efficient iterative process requiring O(NlogN) operations per iteration. The convergence behavior of the algorithm is investigated, and it is shown that under mild conditions the algorithm converges to a globally optimal restoration. Moreover, our new approach performs competitively with, in some cases better than, the best existing methods in benchmark tests.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.814255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217267","","Image restoration;Wavelet domain;Discrete wavelet transforms;Iterative algorithms;Deconvolution;Image reconstruction;Wavelet coefficients;Optimization methods;Image representation;Discrete Fourier transforms","","849","6","35","IEEE","4 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established.

The success of many learning schemes, in their attempts to construct models of data, hinges on the reliable identification of a small set of highly predictive attributes. The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant, and noisy attributes in the model building process phase can result in poor predictive performance and increased computation. Attribute selection generally involves a combination of search and attribute utility estimation plus evaluation with respect to specific learning schemes. This leads to a large number of possible permutations and has led to a situation where very few benchmark studies have been conducted. This paper presents a benchmark comparison of several attribute selection methods for supervised classification. All the methods produce an attribute ranking, a useful devise for isolating the individual merit of an attribute. Attribute selection is achieved by cross-validating the attribute rankings with respect to a classification learner to find the best attributes. Results are reported for a selection of standard data sets and two diverse learning schemes C4.5 and naive Bayes.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1245283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245283","","Data mining;Predictive models;Decision trees;Training data;Data engineering;Reliability engineering;Fasteners;Phase noise;Buildings;Testing","","839","9","16","IEEE","17 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is known that the spatial distribution of network nodes moving according to this model is, in general, nonuniform. However, a closed-form expression of this distribution and an in-depth investigation is still missing. This fact impairs the accuracy of the current simulation methodology of ad hoc networks and makes it impossible to relate simulation-based performance results to corresponding analytical results. To overcome these problems, we present a detailed analytical study of the spatial node distribution generated by random waypoint mobility. More specifically, we consider a generalization of the model in which the pause time of the mobile nodes is chosen arbitrarily in each waypoint and a fraction of nodes may remain static for the entire simulation time. We show that the structure of the resulting distribution is the weighted sum of three independent components: the static, pause, and mobility component. This division enables us to understand how the model's parameters influence the distribution. We derive an exact equation of the asymptotically stationary distribution for movement on a line segment and an accurate approximation for a square area. The good quality of this approximation is validated through simulations using various settings of the mobility parameters.

The communication or message passing process must be designed to conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. Clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the clusterheads communicate the aggregated information to the processing center, may save energy. In this paper, we propose a distributed, randomized clustering algorithm to organize the sensors in a wireless sensor network into clusters.

Based on the concept of sequential importance sampling and the use of Bayesian theory, particle filtering is particularly useful in dealing with difficult nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems. The underlying principle of the methodology is the approximation of relevant distributions with random measures composed of particles (samples from the space of the unknowns) and their associated weights. First, we present a brief review of particle filtering theory; and then we show how it can be used for resolving many problems in wireless communications. We demonstrate its application to blind equalization, blind detection over flat fading channels, multiuser detection, and estimation and detection of space-time codes in fading channels.","1558-0792","","10.1109/MSP.2003.1236770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236770","","Signal processing;Filtering theory;Fading;Power engineering and energy;Statistical distributions;Econometrics;Monte Carlo methods;Bayesian methods;Particle measurements;Wireless communication","","814","3","59","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Some DC-DC converters can provide high step-up voltage gain, but with the penalty of either an extreme duty ratio or a large amount of circulating energy. DC-DC converters with coupled inductors can provide high voltage gain, but their efficiency is degraded by the losses associated with leakage inductors. Converters with active clamps recycle the leakage energy at the price of increasing topology complexity. A family of high-efficiency, high step-up DC-DC converters with simple topologies is proposed in this paper. The proposed converters, which use diodes and coupled windings instead of active switches to realize functions similar to those of active clamps, perform better than their active-clamp counterparts. High efficiency is achieved because the leakage energy is recycled and the output rectifier reverse-recovery problem is alleviated.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2002.807188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187325","","DC-DC power converters;Voltage;Inductors;Clamps;Topology;Degradation;Recycling;Switching converters;Diodes;Switches","","807","11","16","IEEE","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The other source of power dissipation in today's microprocessors, dynamic power, arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today's chips. Until recently, only dynamic power has been a significant source of power consumption, and Moore's law helped control it. However, power consumption has now become a primary microprocessor design constraint; one that researchers in both industry and academia will struggle to overcome in the next few years. Microprocessor design has traditionally focused on dynamic power consumption as a limiting factor in system integration.

Especially more recent multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been shown to be efficient and superior to earlier approaches. An important question however is whether we can expect such improvements to converge onto a specific efficient MOEA that behaves best on a large variety of problems. In this paper, we argue that the development of new MOEAs cannot converge onto a single new most efficient MOEA because the performance of MOEAs shows characteristics of multiobjective problems. While we point out the most important aspects for designing competent MOEAs in this paper, we also indicate the inherent multiobjective tradeoff in multiobjective optimization between proximity and diversity preservation. We discuss the impact of this tradeoff on the concepts and design of exploration and exploitation operators. We also present a general framework for competent MOEAs and show how current state-of-the-art MOEAs can be obtained by making choices within this framework.

This paper focuses on the reflection phase feature of EBG surfaces: when plane waves normally illuminate an EBG structure, the phase of the reflected field changes continuously from 180/spl deg/ to -180/spl deg/ versus frequency. One important application of this feature is that one can replace a conventional perfect electric conductor (PEC) ground plane with an EBG ground plane for a low profile wire antenna design. For this design, the operational frequency band of an EBG structure is defined as the frequency region within which a low profile wire antenna radiates efficiently, namely, having a good return loss and radiation patterns. The operational frequency band is the overlap of the input-match frequency band and the surface-wave frequency bandgap. It is revealed that the reflection phase curve can be used to identify the input-match frequency band inside of which a low profile wire antenna exhibits a good return loss. The surface-wave frequency bandgap of the EBG surface that helps improve radiation patterns is very close to its input-match frequency band, resulting in an effective operational frequency band. In contrast, a thin grounded slab cannot work efficiently as a ground plane for low profile wire antennas because its surface-wave frequency bandgap and input-match frequency band do not overlap. Parametric studies have been performed to obtain design guidelines for EBG ground planes. Two novel EBG ground planes with interesting electromagnetic features are also presented. The rectangular patch EBG ground plane has a polarization dependent reflection phase and the slotted patch EBG ground plane shows a compact size.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236087","","Wire;Reflector antennas;Periodic structures;Frequency;Metamaterials;Electromagnetic reflection;Photonic band gap;Electromagnetic devices;Antenna radiation patterns;Surface waves","","775","36","23","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the rapidly growing field of fractal antenna engineering. Fractal antenna engineering research has been primarily focused in two areas: the first deals with the analysis and design of fractal antenna elements, and the second concerns the application of fractal concepts to the design of antenna arrays. Fractals have no characteristic size, and are generally composed of many copies of themselves at different scales. These unique properties of fractals have been exploited in order to develop a new class of antenna-element designs that are multi-band and/or compact in size. On the other hand, fractal arrays are a subset of thinned arrays, and have been shown to possess several highly desirable properties, including multi-band performance, low sidelobe levels, and the ability to develop rapid beamforming algorithms based on the recursive nature of fractals. Fractal elements and arrays are also ideal candidates for use in reconfigurable systems. Finally, we provide a brief summary of recent work in the related area of fractal frequency-selective surfaces.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1189650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189650","","Fractal antennas;Antenna theory;Geometry;Design engineering;Antennas and propagation;Antenna arrays;Electrodynamics;Electromagnetic scattering;Electromagnetic radiation;Laboratories","","774","8","121","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, the existing wireless channel models, i.e., physical-layer channel models, do not explicitly characterize a wireless channel in terms of these QoS metrics. In this paper, we propose and develop a link-layer channel model termed effective capacity (EC). In this approach, we first model a wireless link by two EC functions, namely, the probability of nonempty buffer, and the QoS exponent of a connection. Then, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to estimate these EC functions. The physical-layer analogs of these two link-layer EC functions are the marginal distribution (e.g., Rayleigh-Ricean distribution) and the Doppler spectrum, respectively. The key advantages of the EC link-layer modeling and estimation are: 1) ease of translation into QoS guarantees, such as delay bounds; 2) simplicity of implementation; and 3) accuracy, and hence, efficiency in admission control and resource reservation. We illustrate the advantage of our approach with a set of simulation experiments, which show that the actual QoS metric is closely approximated by the QoS metric predicted by the EC link-layer model, under a wide range of conditions.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.814353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210731","","Quality of service;Delay estimation;Wireless networks;Admission control;Next generation networking;Predictive models;Communication system traffic control;Traffic control;Fading;Queueing analysis","","752","","15","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the direct method for building up the coupling matrix for the transversal network is described. A simple non-optimization process is then outlined for the conversion of the transversal matrix to the equivalent ""N+2"" folded-configuration coupling matrix. The folded matrix may be used directly to realize microwave bandpass filters in a variety of technologies, but some of these could require awkward-to-realize cross-couplings.

The feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting is first examined by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation (BP) neural network and the regularized radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The variability in performance of SVM with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. Adaptive parameters are then proposed by incorporating the nonstationarity of financial time series into SVM. Five real futures contracts collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The simulation shows that among the three methods, SVM outperforms the BP neural network in financial forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between SVM and the regularized RBF neural network. Furthermore, the free parameters of SVM have a great effect on the generalization performance. SVM with adaptive parameters can both achieve higher generalization performance and use fewer support vectors than the standard SVM in financial forecasting.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.820556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257413","","Support vector machines;Neural networks;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Pattern recognition;Risk management;Contracts;Predictive models;Economic forecasting;Mechanical engineering","","744","","34","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have observed that when some mobile hosts use a lower bit rate than the others, the performance of all hosts is considerably degraded. Such a situation is a common case in wireless local area networks in which a host far away from an access point is subject to important signal fading and interference. To cope with this problem, the host changes its modulation type, which degrades its bit rate to some lower value. Typically, 802.11b products degrade the bit rate from 11 Mb/s to 5.5, 2, or 1 Mb/s when repeated unsuccessful frame transmissions are detected. In such a case, a host transmitting for example at 1 Mb/s reduces the throughput of all other hosts transmitting at 11 Mb/s to a low value below 1 Mb/s. The basic CSMA/CA channel access method is at the root of this anomaly: it guarantees an equal long term channel access probability to all hosts. When one host captures the channel for a long time because its bit rate is low, it penalizes other hosts that use the higher rate. We analyze the anomaly theoretically by deriving simple expressions for the useful throughput, validate them by means of simulation, and compare with several performance measurements.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208921","","Bit rate;Degradation;Wireless LAN;Performance analysis;Throughput;Fading;Interference;Multiaccess communication;Analytical models;Measurement","","739","26","7","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This trend is in line with the imminent transition from third- to fourth-generation radio systems, where heterogeneous environments are expected to prevail eventually. A key driver in this transition is the steep growth in both demand and deployment of WLANs/WPANs based on the wireless standards within the IEEE 802 suite. Today, these short-range devices and networks operate mainly standalone in indoor home and office environments or large enclosed public areas, while their integration into the wireless wide-area infrastructure is still nearly nonexistent and far from trivial. This status quo in the short-range wireless application space is about to be disrupted by novel devices and systems based on the emerging UWB radio technology with the potential to provide solutions for many of today's problems in the areas of spectrum management and radio system engineering. The approach employed by UWB radio devices is based on sharing already occupied spectrum resources by means of the overlay principle, rather than looking for still available but possibly unsuitable new bands. This novel radio technology has received legal adoption by the regulatory authorities in the United States, and efforts to achieve this status in Europe and Asia are underway. This article discusses both the application potential and technical challenges presented by UWB radio as an unconventional but promising new wireless technology.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2003.1215641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215641","","Ultra wideband technology;Frequency;Bandwidth;Physical layer;Intelligent networks;Availability;Systems engineering and theory;Resource management;FCC;Standardization","","737","23","8","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This filter, typically a series inductance, acts to reduce the switching harmonics entering the distribution network. An alternative filter is a LCL network, which can achieve reduced levels of harmonic distortion at lower switching frequencies and with less inductance, and therefore has potential benefits for higher power applications. However, systems incorporating LCL filters require more complex control strategies and are not commonly presented in literature. This paper proposes a robust strategy for regulating the grid current entering a distribution network from a three-phase VSI system connected via a LCL filter. The strategy integrates an outer loop grid current regulator with inner capacitor current regulation to stabilize the system. A synchronous frame PI current regulation strategy is used for the outer grid current control loop. Linear analysis, simulation, and experimental results are used to verify the stability of the control algorithm across a range of operating conditions. Finally, expressions for """"harmonic impedance"" of the system are derived to study the effects of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic performance of the system.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.810838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198069","","Current control;Inverters;Power harmonic filters;Inductance;Harmonic distortion;Power electronics;Automatic voltage control;Distributed control;Switching frequency;Control systems","","735","3","8","IEEE","13 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it tends to change the brightness of an image and hence, not suitable for consumer electronic products, where preserving the original brightness is essential to avoid annoying artifacts. Bi-histogram equalization (BBHE) has been proposed and analyzed mathematically that it can preserve the original brightness to a certain extends. However, there are still cases that are not handled well by BBHE, as they require higher degree of preservation. This paper proposes a novel extension of BBHE referred to as minimum mean brightness error bi-histogram equalization (MMBEBHE) to provide maximum brightness preservation. BBHE separates the input image's histogram into two based on input mean before equalizing them independently. This paper proposes to perform the separation based on the threshold level, which would yield minimum absolute mean brightness error (AMBE - the absolute difference between input and output mean). An efficient recursive integer-based computation for AMBE has been formulated to facilitate real time implementation. Simulation results using sample image which represent images with very low, very high and medium mean brightness show that the cases which are not handled well by HE, BBHE and dualistic sub image histogram equalization (DSIHE), can be properly enhanced by MMBEBHE. Besides, MMBEBHE also demonstrate comparable performance with BBHE and DSIHE when come to use the sample images show in [Yeong-Taeg Kim, February 1997] and [Yu Wan et al., October 5 1999].","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1261234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261234","","Brightness;Histograms;Consumer electronics;Computational modeling;Entropy;Probability distribution;Dynamic range;Biomedical image processing;Radar imaging","","732","2","4","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For such highly volatile systems, decentralized gossip-based protocols are emerging as an approach to maintaining simplicity and scalability while achieving fault-tolerant information dissemination. In this paper, we study the problem of computing aggregates with gossip-style protocols. Our first contribution is an analysis of simple gossip-based protocols for the computation of sums, averages, random samples, quantiles, and other aggregate functions, and we show that our protocols converge exponentially fast to the true answer when using uniform gossip. Our second contribution is the definition of a precise notion of the speed with which a node's data diffuses through the network. We show that this diffusion speed is at the heart of the approximation guarantees for all of the above problems. We analyze the diffusion speed of uniform gossip in the presence of node and link failures, as well as for flooding-based mechanisms. The latter expose interesting connections to random walks on graphs.","0272-5428","0-7695-2040-5","10.1109/SFCS.2003.1238221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238221","","Aggregates;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Large-scale systems;Temperature sensors;Distributed computing;Computer science;Scalability;Fault tolerant systems;Stress","","732","5","36","IEEE","20 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basic idea is to first decompose the image into the sum of two functions with different basic characteristics, and then reconstruct each one of these functions separately with structure and texture filling-in algorithms. The first function used in the decomposition is of bounded variation, representing the underlying image structure, while the second function captures the texture and possible noise. The region of missing information in the bounded variation image is reconstructed using image inpainting algorithms, while the same region in the texture image is filled-in with texture synthesis techniques. The original image is then reconstructed adding back these two sub-images. The novel contribution of this paper is then in the combination of these three previously developed components, image decomposition with inpainting and texture synthesis, which permits the simultaneous use of filling-in algorithms that are suited for different image characteristics. Examples on real images show the advantages of this proposed approach.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.815261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217265","","Image reconstruction;Image decomposition;Image coding;Engineering profession;Switches;Image processing;Image communication;Image restoration;Filling","","731","31","33","IEEE","4 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that the approximation error is bounded and present tools to increase or decrease the density of the points, thus allowing an adjustment of the spacing among the points to control the error.

The universal lower bound provides a concise characterization of the gain with each additional bit of feedback information regarding the channel. Using the bound, it is shown that finite information systems approach the perfect information case as (t-1)2/sup -B/t-1/, where B is the number of feedback bits and t is the number of transmit antennas. The geometrical bounding technique, used in the proof of the lower bound, also leads to a design criterion for good beamformers, whose outage performance approaches the lower bound. The design criterion minimizes the maximum inner product between any two beamforming vectors in the beamformer codebook, and is equivalent to the problem of designing unitary space-time codes under certain conditions.

We present an improved minima controlled recursive averaging (IMCRA) approach, for noise estimation in adverse environments involving nonstationary noise, weak speech components, and low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noise estimate is obtained by averaging past spectral power values, using a time-varying frequency-dependent smoothing parameter that is adjusted by the signal presence probability. The speech presence probability is controlled by the minima values of a smoothed periodogram. The proposed procedure comprises two iterations of smoothing and minimum tracking. The first iteration provides a rough voice activity detection in each frequency band. Then, smoothing in the second iteration excludes relatively strong speech components, which makes the minimum tracking during speech activity robust. We show that in nonstationary noise environments and under low SNR conditions, the IMCRA approach is very effective. In particular, compared to a competitive method, it obtains a lower estimation error, and when integrated into a speech enhancement system achieves improved speech quality and lower residual noise.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.811544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223596","","Working environment noise;Spectral analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Speech enhancement;Smoothing methods;Frequency estimation;Speech recognition;Recursive estimation;Noise robustness;Estimation error","","699","107","22","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm, which is based on dimensionality reduction and partial Voronoi diagram construction, can be used for computing the DT for a wide class of distance functions, including the L/sub p/ and chamfer metrics. At each dimension level, the DT is computed by constructing the intersection of the Voronoi diagram whose sites are the feature voxels with each row of the image. This construction is performed efficiently by using the DT in the next lower dimension. The correctness and linear time complexity are demonstrated analytically and verified experimentally. The algorithm may be of practical value since it is relatively simple and easy to implement and it is relatively fast (not only does it run in O(N) time but the time constant is small). A simple modification of the algorithm computes the weighted Euclidean DT, which is useful for images with anisotropic voxel dimensions. A parallel version of the algorithm runs in O(N/p) time with p processors.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1177156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177156","","Euclidean distance;Skeleton;Image processing;Computer vision;Interpolation;Pattern matching;Surface morphology;Image registration;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Nearest neighbor searches","","697","9","49","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.810682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202973","","Filters;Laser radar;Vegetation mapping;Area measurement;Surfaces;Digital elevation models;Floods;Predictive models;Terrain factors;Clouds","","687","","16","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The appearance model involves a mixture of stable image structure, learned over long time courses, along with two-frame motion information and an outlier process. An online EM-algorithm is used to adapt the appearance model parameters over time. An implementation of this approach is developed for an appearance model based on the filter responses from a steerable pyramid. This model is used in a motion-based tracking algorithm to provide robustness in the face of image outliers, such as those caused by occlusions, while adapting to natural changes in appearance such as those due to facial expressions or variations in 3D pose.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1233903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233903","","Robustness;Motion estimation;Target tracking;Biological system modeling;Computer Society;Stability;Adaptive optics;Optical filters;Image motion analysis;Image coding","","679","9","36","IEEE","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a new, general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209219","","Intelligent networks;Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Communication system security;Mobile communication;NASA;Military communication;Business communication","","672","9","44","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Images of any given concept are regarded as instances of a stochastic process that characterizes the concept. To measure the extent of association between an image and the textual description of a concept, the likelihood of the occurrence of the image based on the characterizing stochastic process is computed. A high likelihood indicates a strong association. In our experimental implementation, we focus on a particular group of stochastic processes, that is, the two-dimensional multiresolution hidden Markov models (2D MHMMs). We implemented and tested our ALIP (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures) system on a photographic image database of 600 different concepts, each with about 40 training images. The system is evaluated quantitatively using more than 4,600 images outside the training database and compared with a random annotation scheme.

In general, a typical iris recognition system includes iris imaging, iris liveness detection, and recognition. This paper focuses on the last issue and describes a new scheme for iris recognition from an image sequence. We first assess the quality of each image in the input sequence and select a clear iris image from such a sequence for subsequent recognition. A bank of spatial filters, whose kernels are suitable for iris recognition, is then used to capture local characteristics of the iris so as to produce discriminating texture features. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an encouraging performance. In particular, a comparative study of existing methods for iris recognition is conducted on an iris image database including 2,255 sequences from 213 subjects. Conclusions based on such a comparison using a nonparametric statistical method (the bootstrap) provide useful information for further research.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251145","","Biometrics;Iris recognition;Image recognition;Security;Image sequences;Spatial filters;Fingerprint recognition;Kernel;Image databases;Statistical analysis","","666","33","43","IEEE","8 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper argues that modeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a more structured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this problem.

The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely.

For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1208999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208999","","Web search;Web pages;Vectors;Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Content based retrieval;Keyword search;High performance computing;Large-scale systems;Information analysis","","658","80","30","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exponentially stable periodic orbits of the zero dynamics correspond to exponentially stabilizable orbits of the full model. A convenient parameterization of the hybrid zero dynamics is imposed through the choice of a class of output functions.

This can lead to substantial power savings at the sensors as they only have to transmit over a short range. This paper focuses on a simple analytical model for understanding performance as system parameters are scaled. Our model assumes two-dimensional random walk for mobility and incorporates key system variables such as number of MULEs, sensors and access points. The performance metrics observed are the data success rate (the fraction of generated data that reaches the access points) and the required buffer capacities on the sensors and the MULEs. The modeling along with simulation results can be used for further analysis and provide certain guidelines for deployment of such systems.","","0-7803-7879-2","10.1109/SNPA.2003.1203354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203354","","Monitoring;Delay;Analytical models;Power system modeling;Capacitive sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Data analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Costs;Base stations","","646","7","24","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Techniques to deal with these transients faults exist, but come at a cost. Designers clearly require accurate estimates of processor error rates to make appropriate cost/reliability tradeoffs. This paper describes a method for generating these estimates. A key aspect of this analysis is that some single-bit faults (such as those occurring in the branch predictor) do not produce an error in a program's output. We define a structure's architectural vulnerability factor (AVF) as the probability that a fault in that particular structure do not result in an error. A structure's error rate is the product of its raw error rate, as determined by process and circuit technology, and the AVF. Unfortunately, computing AVFs of complex structures, such as the instruction queue, can be quite involved. We identify numerous cases, such as prefetches, dynamically dead code, and wrong-path instructions, in which a fault do not affect, correct execution. We instrument a detailed 1A64 processor simulator to map bit-level microarchitectural state to these cases, generating per-structure AVF estimates. This analysis shows AVFs of 28% and 9% for the instruction queue and execution units, respectively, averaged across dynamic sections of the entire CPU2000 benchmark suite.","","0-7695-2043-X","10.1109/MICRO.2003.1253181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253181","","Microprocessors;Circuit faults;Error analysis;Costs;Computer aided instruction;Fault diagnosis;Prefetching;Instruments;Computational modeling;Circuit simulation","","646","17","28","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A judicious combination of attractive and repulsive forces is used to determine virtual motion paths and the rate of movement for the randomly-placed sensors. Once the effective sensor positions are identified, a one-time movement with energy consideration incorporated is carried out, i.e., the sensors are redeployed to these positions.

The method relies upon the notions of system immersion and manifold invariance and, in principle, does not require the knowledge of a (control) Lyapunov function. The construction of the stabilizing control laws resembles the procedure used in nonlinear regulator theory to derive the (invariant) output zeroing manifold and its friend. The method is well suited in situations where we know a stabilizing controller of a nominal reduced order model, which we would like to robustify with respect to higher order dynamics. This is achieved by designing a control law that asymptotically immerses the full system dynamics into the reduced order one. We also show that in adaptive control problems the method yields stabilizing schemes that counter the effect of the uncertain parameters adopting a robustness perspective. Our construction does not invoke certainty equivalence, nor requires a linear parameterization, furthermore, viewed from a Lyapunov perspective, it provides a procedure to add cross terms between the parameter estimates and the plant states. Finally, it is shown that the proposed approach is directly applicable to systems in feedback and feedforward form, yielding new stabilizing control laws. We illustrate the method with several academic and practical examples, including a mechanical system with flexibility modes, an electromechanical system with parasitic actuator dynamics and an adaptive nonlinearly parameterized visual servoing application.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.809820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193738","","Adaptive control;Nonlinear systems;Control systems;Robust control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Design methodology;Lyapunov method;Regulators;Reduced order systems;Counting circuits","","638","2","44","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the images. It is also insensitive to 'noise' images which are not part of the panorama at all, that is, it recognises panoramas.

In this paper, a new mathematical model for IPMSMs is proposed and an extended EMF is defined, which includes both position information from the EMF and the stator inductance. By using the newly proposed model, sensorless controls proposed for SPMSMs can easily be applied to IPMSMs. As an example, a disturbance observer is studied and the experimental results show that the proposed method on the proposed model is very effective.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.809391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191804","","Force sensors;Sensorless control;Synchronous motors;Mathematical model;Voltage;Inductance;Testing;Stators;Rotors;Stability","","635","4","12","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The NOR cell is basically a floating-gate MOS transistor, programmed by channel hot electron and erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The main reliability issues, such as charge retention and endurance, are discussed, together with an understanding of the basic physical mechanisms responsible. Most of these considerations are also valid for the NAND cell, since it is based on the same concept of floating-gate MOS transistor. Furthermore, an insight into the multilevel approach, where two bits are stored in the same cell, is presented. In fact, the exploitation of the multilevel approach at each technology node allows an increase of the memory efficiency, almost doubling the density at the same chip size, enlarging the application range and reducing the cost per bit. Finally, NOR flash cell scaling issues are covered, pointing out the main challenges. Flash cell scaling has been demonstrated to be really possible and to be able to follow Moore's law down to the 130-nm technology generations. Technology development and consolidated know-how is expected to sustain the scaling trend down to 90- and 65-nm technology nodes. One of the crucial issues to be solved to allow cell scaling below the 65-nm node is the tunnel oxide thickness reduction, as tunnel thinning is limited by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.811702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199079","","Flash memory;Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Semiconductor memory;Writing;Costs;MOSFETs;CMOS technology;Power supplies;EPROM","","633","219","33","IEEE","21 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Contrast enhancement using recursive mean-separate histogram equalization for scalable brightness preservation","Soong-Der Chen; A. R.

However, it tends to change the brightness of an image and hence, not suitable for consumer electronic products, where preserving the original brightness is essential to avoid annoying artifacts. Bi-histogram equalization (BBHE) has been proposed and analyzed mathematically that it can preserve the original brightness to a certain extend. However, there are still cases that are not handled well by BBHE, as they require higher degree of preservation. This paper proposes a generalization of BBHE referred to as recursive mean-separate histogram equalization (RMSHE) to provide not only better but also scalable brightness preservation. BBHE separates the input image's histogram into two based on its mean before equalizing them independently. While the separation is done only once in BBHE, this paper proposes to perform the separation recursively; separate each new histogram further based on their respective mean. It is analyzed mathematically that the output image's mean brightness will converge to the input image's mean brightness as the number of recursive mean separation increases. Besides, the recursive nature of RMSHE also allows scalable brightness preservation, which is very useful in consumer electronics. Simulation results show that the cases which are not handled well by HE, BBHE and dualistic sub image histogram equalization (DSIHE), have been properly enhanced by RMSHE.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1261233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261233","","Histograms;Brightness;Consumer electronics;Image analysis;Entropy;Image converters;Probability distribution;Dynamic range;Biomedical image processing","","624","1","6","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to significantly strengthen random key predistribution's strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links.

The main positive effect of the hybridization is the improvement in the convergence speed to the Pareto front. On the other hand, the main negative effect is the increase in the computation time per generation. Thus, the number of generations is decreased when the available computation time is limited. As a result, the global search ability of EMO algorithms is not fully utilized. These positive and negative effects are examined by computational experiments on multiobjective permutation flowshop scheduling problems. Results of our computational experiments clearly show the importance of striking a balance between genetic search and local search. In this paper, we first modify our former multiobjective genetic local search (MOGLS) algorithm by choosing only good individuals as initial solutions for local search and assigning an appropriate local search direction to each initial solution. Next, we demonstrate the importance of striking a balance between genetic search and local search through computational experiments. Then we compare the modified MOGLS with recently developed EMO algorithms: the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm and revised nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate that a local search can be easily combined with those EMO algorithms for designing multiobjective memetic algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.810752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197692","","Scheduling algorithm;Evolutionary computation;Informatics;Convergence;Processor scheduling;Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Job shop scheduling;Cultural differences","","613","","50","IEEE","7 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Propagation analysis provides a good initial estimate of the signal characteristics. The ability to accurately predict radio-propagation behavior for wireless personal communication systems, such as cellular mobile radio, is becoming crucial to system design. Since site measurements are costly, propagation models have been developed as a suitable, low-cost, and convenient alternative. Channel modeling is required to predict path, loss and to characterize the impulse response of the propagating channel. The path loss is associated with the design of base stations, as this tells us how much a transmitter needs to radiate to service a given region. Channel characterization, on the other hand, deals with the fidelity of the received signals, and has to do with the nature of the waveform received at a receiver. The objective here is to design a suitable receiver that will receive the transmitted signal, distorted due to the multipath and dispersion effects of the channel, and that will decode the transmitted signal. An understanding of the various propagation models can actually address both problems. This paper begins with a review of the information available on the various propagation models for both indoor and outdoor environments. The existing models can be classified into two major classes: statistical models and site-specific models. The main characteristics of the radio channel - such as path loss, fading, and time-delay spread - are discussed. Currently, a third alternative, which includes many new numerical methods, is being introduced to propagation prediction. The advantages and disadvantages of some of these methods are summarized. In addition, an impulse-response characterization for the propagation path is also presented, including models for small-scale fading, Finally, it is shown that when two-way communication ports can be defined for a mobile system, it is possible to use reciprocity to focus the energy along the direction of an intended user without any explicit knowledge of the electromagnetic environment in which the system is operating, or knowledge of the spatial locations of the transmitter and the receiver.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2003.1232163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232163","","Mobile communication;Propagation losses;Fading;Parameter estimation;Signal analysis;Wireless communication;Land mobile radio;System analysis and design;Predictive models;Base stations","","612","2","161","IEEE","15 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

An array of antennas is located near the surface of the breast and an ultrawideband (UWB) signal is transmitted sequentially from each antenna. The received backscattered signals are passed through a space-time beamformer that is designed to image backscattered signal energy as a function of location. The beamformer spatially focuses the backscattered signals to discriminate against clutter and noise while compensating for frequency-dependent propagation effects. As a consequence of the significant dielectric-properties contrast between normal and malignant tissue, localized regions of large backscatter energy levels in the image correspond to malignant tumors. A data-adaptive algorithm for removing artifacts in the received signals due to backscatter from the skin-breast interface is also presented. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated using a variety of numerical breast phantoms based on anatomically realistic MRI-derived FDTD models of the breast. Very small (2 mm) malignant tumors embedded within the complex fibroglandular structure of the breast are easily detected above the background clutter. The MIST approach is shown to offer significant improvement in performance over previous UWB microwave breast cancer detection techniques based on simpler focusing schemes.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.815446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219578","","Microwave imaging;Array signal processing;Cancer detection;Breast cancer;Microwave theory and techniques;Transmitting antennas;Ultra wideband antennas;Backscatter;Malignant tumors;Antenna arrays","","608","7","22","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The wavelet transform, in conjunction with a simple kinematics model, was used to detect different postural transitions (PTs) and walking periods during daily physical activity. To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was first tested on 11 community-dwelling elderly subjects in a gait laboratory where an optical motion system (Vicon) was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested for classifying PTs (i.e., lying-to-sitting, sitting-to-lying, and turning the body in bed) in 24 hospitalized elderly persons. Finally, in a third study monitoring was performed on nine elderly persons for 45-60 min during their daily physical activity. Moreover, the possibility-to-perform long-term monitoring over 12 h has been shown. The first study revealed a close concordance between the ambulatory and reference systems. Overall, subjects performed 349 PTs during this study. Compared with the reference system, the ambulatory system had an overall sensitivity of 99% for detection of the different PTs. Sensitivities and specificities were 93% and 82% in sit-to-stand, and 82% and 94% in stand-to-sit, respectively.

One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay, i.e., that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items, and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item. We replicate the analysis of change data in a different organization with a different product and different sites and confirm our main findings. We also report survey results showing differences between same-site and distributed social networks, testing several hypotheses about characteristics of distributed social networks that may be related to delay.

The proposed approach is based on three steps. First, the composition of geodesic opening and closing operations of different sizes is used in order to build a differential morphological profile that records image structural information. Although, the original panchromatic image only has one data channel, the use of the composition operations will give many additional channels, which may contain redundancies. Therefore, feature extraction or feature selection is applied in the second step. Both discriminant analysis feature extraction and decision boundary feature extraction are investigated in the second step along with a simple feature selection based on picking the largest indexes of the differential morphological profiles. Third, a neural network is used to classify the features from the second step. The proposed approach is applied in experiments on high-resolution Indian Remote Sensing 1C (IRS-1C) and IKONOS remote sensing data from urban areas. In experiments, the proposed method performs well in terms of classification accuracies.

We present an approach to computing semantic similarity that relaxes the requirement of a single ontology and accounts for differences in the levels of explicitness and formalization of the different ontology specifications. A similarity function determines similar entity classes by using a matching process over synonym sets, semantic neighborhoods, and distinguishing features that are classified into parts, functions, and attributes. Experimental results with different ontologies indicate that the model gives good results when ontologies have complete and detailed representations of entity classes. While the combination of word matching and semantic neighborhood matching is adequate for detecting equivalent entity classes, feature matching allows us to discriminate among similar, but not necessarily equivalent entity classes.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1185844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185844","","Ontologies;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Automatic logic units;Computer Society;Database languages;Knowledge management;Cities and towns;Computational modeling","","603","10","61","IEEE","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we introduce an extended service oriented architecture that provides separate tiers for composing and coordinating services and for managing services in an open marketplace by employing grid services.","","0-7695-1999-7","10.1109/WISE.2003.1254461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254461","","Distributed computing;Service oriented architecture;Management information systems;Application software;Grid computing;Web and internet services;Standards organizations;Protocols;Handheld computers;Personal digital assistants","","601","6","15","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown that the optimal pilot sequences are equipowered, equispaced, and phase shift orthogonal. To reduce the training overhead, an LS channel estimation scheme over multiple OFDM symbols is also discussed. Moreover, to enhance channel estimation, a recursive LS (RLS) algorithm is proposed, for which we derive the optimal forgetting or tracking factor. This factor is found to be a function of both the noise variance and the channel Doppler spread. Through simulations, it is shown that the optimal pilot sequences derived in this paper outperform both the orthogonal and random pilot sequences.

Condition based maintenance and online monitoring are now gaining importance. Currently there are varieties of chemical and electrical diagnostic techniques available for insulation condition monitoring of power transformers. This paper presents a description of commonly used chemical diagnostics techniques along with their interpretation schemes. A number of new chemical techniques are also described in this paper.

The pixel candidates are selected from those presenting a good coherence level in the whole set of interferograms and the resulting nonuniform mesh tessellated with the Delauney triangulation to establish connections among them. The linear component of movement and DEM error are estimated adjusting a linear model to the data only on the connections. Later on, this information, once unwrapped to retrieve the absolute values, is used to calculate the nonlinear component of movement and atmospheric artifacts with alternate filtering techniques in both the temporal and spatial domains. The method presents high flexibility with respect to the required number of images and the baselines length. However, better results are obtained with large datasets of short baseline interferograms.

Moving shadow detection is critical for accurate object detection in video streams since shadow points are often misclassified as object points, causing errors in segmentation and tracking. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature that deal with shadows. However, a comparative evaluation of the existing approaches is still lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of moving shadow detection approaches. We organize contributions reported in the literature in four classes two of them are statistical and two are deterministic. We also present a comparative empirical evaluation of representative algorithms selected from these four classes. Novel quantitative (detection and discrimination rate) and qualitative metrics (scene and object independence, flexibility to shadow situations, and robustness to noise) are proposed to evaluate these classes of algorithms on a benchmark suite of indoor and outdoor video sequences.

This study examines different approaches to protect a mesh-based WDM optical network from such failures. These approaches are based on two survivability paradigms: 1) path protection/restoration and 2) link protection/restoration. The study examines the wavelength capacity requirements, and routing and wavelength assignment of primary and backup paths for path and link protection and proposes distributed protocols for path and link restoration. The study also examines the protection-switching time and the restoration time for each of these schemes, and the susceptibility of these schemes to multiple link failures. The numerical results obtained for a representative network topology with random traffic demands demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between the capacity utilization and the susceptibility to multiple link failures. We find that, on one hand, path protection provides significant capacity savings over link protection, and shared protection provides significant savings over dedicated protection; while on the other hand, path protection is more susceptible to multiple link failures than link protection, and shared protection is more susceptible to multiple link failures than dedicated protection. We formulate a model of protection-switching times for the different protection schemes based on a fully distributed control network. We propose distributed control protocols for path and link restoration. Numerical results obtained by simulating these protocols indicate that, for a representative network topology, path restoration has a better restoration efficiency than link restoration, and link restoration has a faster restoration time compared with path restoration.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2002.806338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207336","","Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Mesh networks;Protection;Optical fiber networks;Network topology;Distributed control;Protocols;Optical fiber losses;Wavelength routing","","573","2","27","IEEE","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system can output three types of summaries: i) all slow-motion segments in a game; ii) all goals in a game; iii) slow-motion segments classified according to object-based features. The first two types of summaries are based on cinematic features only for speedy processing, while the summaries of the last type contain higher-level semantics. The proposed framework is efficient, effective, and robust. It is efficient in the sense that there is no need to compute object-based features when cinematic features are sufficient for the detection of certain events, e.g., goals in soccer. It is effective in the sense that the framework can also employ object-based features when needed to increase accuracy (at the expense of more computation).

This problem has been studied in the information theory literature under the name of the Slepian-Wolf (1973) source coding problem for the lossless coding case, and as ""rate-distortion with side information"" for the lossy coding case. We provide a constructive practical framework based on algebraic trellis codes dubbed as DIstributed Source Coding Using Syndromes (DISCUS), that can be applicable in a variety of settings. Simulation results are presented for source coding of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian sources with side information available at the decoder in the form of a noisy version of the source to be coded. Our results reveal the promise of this approach: using trellis-based quantization and coset construction, the performance of the proposed approach is 2-5 dB from the Wyner-Ziv (1976) bound.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.808103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184140","","Source coding;Decoding;Sensor arrays;Information theory;Image sensors;Layout;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Convolutional codes;Gaussian noise;Quantization","","561","26","32","IEEE","10 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The launch of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observing 1 Hyperion sensor in November 2000 marked the establishment of a test bed for spaceborne hyperspectral capabilities. Hyperion covers the 0.4-2.5-/spl mu/m range with 242 spectral bands at approximately 10-nm spectral resolution and 30-m spatial resolution. Analytical Imaging and Geophysics LLC and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have been involved in efforts to evaluate, validate, and demonstrate Hyperions's utility for geologic mapping in a variety of sites in the United States and around the world. Initial results over several sites with established ground truth and years of airborne hyperspectral data show that Hyperion data from the shortwave infrared spectrometer can be used to produce useful geologic (mineralogic) information. Minerals mapped include carbonates, chlorite, epidote, kaolinite, alunite, buddingtonite, muscovite, hydrothermal silica, and zeolite. Hyperion data collected under optimum conditions (summer season, bright targets, well-exposed geology) indicate that Hyperion data meet prelaunch specifications and allow subtle distinctions such as determining the difference between calcite and dolomite and mapping solid solution differences in micas caused by substitution in octahedral molecular sites. Comparison of airborne hyperspectral data [from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)] to the Hyperion data establishes that Hyperion provides similar basic mineralogic information, with the principal limitation being limited mapping of fine spectral detail under less-than-optimum acquisition conditions (winter season, dark targets) based on lower signal-to-noise ratios. Case histories demonstrate the analysis methodologies and level of information available from the Hyperion data. They also show the viability of Hyperion as a means of extending hyperspectral mineral mapping to areas not accessible to aircraft sensors. The analysis results demonstrate that spaceborne hyperspectral sensors can produce useful mineralogic information, but also indicate that SNR improvements are required for future spaceborne sensors to allow the same level of mapping that is currently possible from airborne sensors such as AVIRIS.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.812908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220247","","Hyperspectral imaging;Minerals;Hyperspectral sensors;Geology;Infrared spectra;Spatial resolution;Spectroscopy;Information analysis;Earth;Testing","","561","1","32","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the exact expression of the c.f., the probability density function (pdf) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be easily obtained, thus enabling the exact evaluation of the outage and mean capacity of spatially correlated MIMO channels. Our results are valid for scenarios with the number of transmitting antennas greater than or equal to that of receiving antennas with arbitrary correlation among them. Moreover, the results are valid for an arbitrary number of transmitting and receiving antennas in uncorrelated MIMO channels.

Since not many MANETs are currently deployed, research in this area is mostly simulation based. Random waypoint is the commonly used mobility model in these simulations. Random waypoint is a simple model that may be applicable to some scenarios. However, we believe that it is not sufficient to capture some important mobility characteristics of scenarios in which MANETs may be deployed. Our framework aims to evaluate the impact of different mobility models on the performance of MANET routing protocols. We propose various protocol independent metrics to capture interesting mobility characteristics, including spatial and temporal dependence and geographic restrictions. In addition, a rich set of parameterized mobility models is introduced including random waypoint, group mobility, freeway and Manhattan models. Based on these models several 'test-suite' scenarios are chosen carefully to span the metric space. We demonstrate the utility of our test-suite by evaluating various MANET routing protocols, including DSR, AODV and DSDV. Our results show that the protocol performance may vary drastically across mobility models and performance rankings of protocols may vary with the mobility models used. This effect can be explained by the interaction of the mobility characteristics with the connectivity graph properties. Finally, we attempt to decompose the routing protocols into mechanistic ""building blocks"" to gain a deeper insight into the performance variations across protocols in the face of mobility.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208920","","Performance analysis;Routing protocols;Mobile ad hoc networks;Traffic control;Wireless communication;Computer science;Mobile computing;Testing;Performance gain;Telecommunication traffic","","554","1","15","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that CNTFETs are very competitive with state-of-the-art conventional devices. We also discuss the switching mechanism of CNTFETs and show that it involves the modulation by the gate field of Schottky barriers at the metal-CNT junctions. This switching mechanism can account for the observed subthreshold and vertical scaling behavior of CNTFETs, as well as their sensitivity to atmospheric oxygen. The potential for integration of CNT devices is demonstrated by fabricating a logic gate along a single nanotube molecule.

Both time domain training and frequency domain (FD) training are investigated. For FD training, maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio of the training symbol was taken into consideration. The channel estimation scheme based on the designed training symbol was also incorporated in the system in order to give both fine-timing and frequency-offset estimates. For fine frequency estimation, two approaches are presented. The first one is based on the suppression of the interference introduced in the frequency estimation process by the training symbol pattern in the context of multipath dispersive channels. The second one is based on the maximum likelihood principle and does not suffer from any interference. A new performance measure is introduced for timing estimation, which is based on the plot of signal to timing-error-induced average interference power ratio against the timing estimate shift. A simple approach for finding the optimal setting of the timing estimator is presented.

These require accurate models of doubly fed induction generator wind turbines and their associated control and protection circuits. A dynamic model has been derived, which can be used to simulate the DFIG wind turbine using a single-cage and double-cage representation of the generator rotor, as well as a representation of its control and protection circuits. The model is suitable for use in transient stability programs that can be used to investigate large power systems.

A new strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) based approach is proposed to handle the EED as a true multiobjective optimization problem with competing and noncommensurable objectives. The proposed approach employs a diversity-preserving mechanism to overcome the premature convergence and search bias problems. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is also imposed to provide the decision maker with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set. Moreover, fuzzy set theory is employed to extract the best compromise nondominated solution. Several optimization runs of the proposed approach have been carried out on a standard test system. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions of the multiobjective EED problem in one single run. The comparison with the classical techniques demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach and confirms its potential to solve the multiobjective EED problem.

Research suggests, however, that the degree and impact of trust, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use change with experience. Using existing, validated scales, this study describes a free-simulation experiment that compares the degree and relative importance of customer trust in an e-vendor vis-a-vis TAM constructs of the website, between potential (i.e., new) customers and repeat (i.e., experienced) ones. The study found that repeat customers trusted the e-vendor more, perceived the website to be more useful and easier to use, and were more inclined to purchase from it. The data also show that while repeat customers' purchase intentions were influenced by both their trust in the e-vendor and their perception that the website was useful, potential customers were not influenced by perceived usefulness, but only by their trust in the e-vendor.

A large real-time application is decomposed into nearly autonomous clusters and nodes, and a fault-tolerant global time base of known precision is generated at every node. In the TTA, this global time is used to precisely specify the interfaces among the nodes, to simplify the communication and agreement protocols, to perform prompt error detection, and to guarantee the timeliness of real-time applications. The TTA supports a two-phased design methodology, architecture design, and component design. During the architecture design phase, the interactions among the distributed components and the interfaces of the components are fully specified in the value domain and in the temporal domain. In the succeeding component implementation phase, the components are built, taking these interface specifications as constraints. This two-phased design methodology is a prerequisite for the composability of applications implemented in the TTA and for the reuse of prevalidated components within the TTA. This paper presents the architecture model of the TTA, explains the design rationale, discusses the time-triggered communication protocols TTP/C and TTP/A, and illustrates how transparent fault tolerance can be implemented in the TTA.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.805821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173202","","Computer architecture;Application software;Fault tolerance;Aerospace control;Distributed computing;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Protocols;Design methodology;Embedded software","","527","14","64","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of minimizing total power consumption with constraints on bit-error rate and transmission rate for users requiring different classes of service is formulated and simple algorithms with good performance are derived. The problem of joint allocation is divided into two steps. In the first step, the number of subcarriers that each user gets is determined based on the users' average signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm is shown to find the distribution of subcarriers that minimizes the total power required when every user experiences a flat-fading channel. In the second stage of the algorithm, it finds the best assignment of subcarriers to users. Two different approaches are presented, the rate-craving greedy algorithm and the amplitude-craving greedy algorithm. A single cell with one base station and many mobile stations is considered.

Their analysis most often concerns the computation of steady-state and transient-state probabilities. This paper introduces a branching temporal logic for expressing real-time probabilistic properties on CTMCs and presents approximate model checking algorithms for this logic. The logic, an extension of the continuous stochastic logic CSL of Aziz et al. (1995, 2000), contains a time-bounded until operator to express probabilistic timing properties over paths as well as an operator to express steady-state probabilities. We show that the model checking problem for this logic reduces to a system of linear equations (for unbounded until and the steady-state operator) and a Volterra integral equation system (for time-bounded until). We then show that the problem of model-checking time-bounded until properties can be reduced to the problem of computing transient state probabilities for CTMCs. This allows the verification of probabilistic timing properties by efficient techniques for transient analysis for CTMCs such as uniformization. Finally, we show that a variant of lumping equivalence (bisimulation), a well-known notion for aggregating CTMCs, preserves the validity of all formulas in the logic.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1205180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1205180","","Steady-state;Stochastic processes;Probabilistic logic;Transient analysis;System performance;Timing;Integral equations;Performance analysis;Throughput;Production systems","","526","","72","IEEE","20 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, new but compact expressions for the complementary field coefficients can be obtained after quite lengthy mathematical manipulations. Three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of surface emission from Gaussian rough surfaces were used to examine the validity of the model. The results based on the new version (advanced IEM) indicate that significant improvements for emissivity prediction may be obtained for a wide range of roughness scales, in particular in the intermediate roughness regions.

The field distributions inside and outside such paired slabs are analyzed, and the Poynting vector distributions in such structures are studied. Using equivalent transmission-line models, we obtain the conditions for the resonance, complete tunneling and transparency, and we justify and explain the field behavior in these resonant paired structures.

"Capacity of multiple-antenna fading channels: spatial fading correlation, double scattering, and keyhole","Hyundong Shin; Jae Hong Lee","School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,"14 Oct 2003","2003","49","10","2636","2647","The capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels is limited by both the spatial fading correlation and rank deficiency of the channel. While spatial fading correlation reduces the diversity gains, rank deficiency due to double scattering or keyhole effects decreases the spatial multiplexing gains of multiple-antenna channels. In this paper, taking into account realistic propagation environments in the presence of spatial fading correlation, double scattering, and keyhole effects, we analyze the ergodic (or mean) MIMO capacity for an arbitrary finite number of transmit and receive antennas. We assume that the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver so that equal power is allocated to each of the transmit antennas. Using some statistical properties of complex random matrices such as Gaussian matrices, Wishart (1928) matrices, and quadratic forms in the Gaussian matrix, we present a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of independent Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels and a tight upper bound for spatially correlated/double scattering MIMO channels.

Emotional intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most important for successful interpersonal social interaction. This paper argues that next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI) designs need to include the essence of emotional intelligence - the ability to recognize a user's affective states-in order to become more human-like, more effective, and more efficient. Affective arousal modulates all nonverbal communicative cues (facial expressions, body movements, and vocal and physiological reactions). In a face-to-face interaction, humans detect and interpret those interactive signals of their communicator with little or no effort. Yet design and development of an automated system that accomplishes these tasks is rather difficult. This paper surveys the past work in solving these problems by a computer and provides a set of recommendations for developing the first part of an intelligent multimodal HCI-an automatic personalized analyzer of a user's nonverbal affective feedback.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.817122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1230215","","Human computer interaction;Emotion recognition;Face detection;Animation;Anthropometry;Neuroscience;Psychology;Cognitive science;Knowledge based systems;Feedback","","496","11","126","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using parameters of the mechanical system, the piezoelectric element, and the converter; the ""optimal"" duty cycle can be determined where the harvested power is maximized for the level of mechanical excitation. It is shown that, as the magnitude of the mechanical excitation increases, the optimal duty cycle becomes essentially constant, greatly simplifying the control of the step-down converter. The expression is validated with experimental data showing that the optimal duty cycle can be accurately determined and maximum energy harvesting attained. A circuit is proposed which implements this relationship, and experimental results show that the converter increases the harvested power by approximately 325%.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.809379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189621","","Circuits;Piezoelectric devices;Vibrations;Load flow;Power supplies;Batteries;Optimization methods;Mechanical systems;Optimal control","","495","12","9","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Another challenging issue investigated is the system grounding. These issues become challenging mainly due to the neutral voltage shift associated with the power converters. The paper shows that converter interactions can be minimized with proper filtering and control on the converters. The paper also proposes a grounding scheme and shows that this scheme provides an effective solution by keeping the neutral voltages low under normal conditions and by limiting the fault currents during fault conditions.

The basic idea in SLoPS is that the one-way delays of a periodic packet stream show an increasing trend when the stream's rate is higher than the avail-bw. We have implemented SLoPS in a tool called pathload. The accuracy of the tool has been evaluated with both simulations and experiments over real-world Internet paths. Pathload is nonintrusive, meaning that it does not cause significant increases in the network utilization, delays, or losses. We used pathload to evaluate the variability (""dynamics"") of the avail-bw in Internet paths. The avail-bw becomes significantly more variable in heavily utilized paths, as well as in paths with limited capacity (probably due to a lower degree of statistical multiplexing). We finally examine the relation between avail-bw and TCP throughput. A persistent TCP connection can be used to measure roughly the avail-bw in a path, but TCP saturates the path and increases significantly the path delays and jitter.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.815304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224454","","Bandwidth;Throughput;Quality of service;Network servers;Delay;Internet;Transport protocols;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Capacity planning","","480","12","30","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The macromodel provides an effective and accurate design tool for this class of MEMS devices. The macromodel is obtained by discretizing the distributed-parameter system using a Galerkin procedure into a finite-degree-of-freedom system consisting of ordinary-differential equations in time. The macromodel accounts for moderately large deflections, dynamic loads, and the coupling between the mechanical and electrical forces. It accounts for linear and nonlinear elastic restoring forces and the nonlinear electric forces generated by the capacitors. A new technique is developed to represent the electric force in the equations of motion. The new approach allows the use of few linear-undamped mode shapes of a microbeam in its straight position as basis functions in a Galerkin procedure. The macromodel is validated by comparing its results with experimental results and finite-element solutions available in the literature. Our approach shows attractive features compared to finite-element softwares used in the literature. It is robust over the whole device operation range up to the instability limit of the device (i.e., pull-in). Moreover, it has low computational cost and allows for an easier understanding of the influence of the various design parameters. As a result, it can be of significant benefit to the development of MEMS design software.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.818069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240138","","Reduced order systems;Micromechanical devices;Nonlinear equations;Finite element methods;Microelectromechanical devices;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Capacitors;Shape;Robustness;Computational efficiency","","479","1","15","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No numerical approximation is involved in deriving the moments, since the weighted Krawtchouk polynomials are discrete. These properties make the Krawtchouk moments well suited as pattern features in the analysis of two-dimensional images. It is shown that the Krawtchouk moments can be employed to extract local features of an image, unlike other orthogonal moments, which generally capture the global features. The computational aspects of the moments using the recursive and symmetry properties are discussed. The theoretical framework is validated by an experiment on image reconstruction using Krawtchouk moments and the results are compared to that of Zernike, pseudo-Zernike, Legendre, and Tchebyscheff moments.

More specifically, these properties are examined within the context of the popular linear antiwindup augmentation paradigm. Linear antiwindup augmentation refers to designing a linear filter to augment a linear control system subject to a local specification, called the ""unconstrained closed-loop behavior."" Building on known results on H/sub /spl infin// and LPV synthesis, the fixed order linear antiwindup synthesis feasibility problem is cast as a nonconvex matrix optimization problem, which has an attractive system theoretic interpretation: the lower bound on the achievable L/sub 2/ performance is the maximum of the open and unconstrained closed-loop L/sub 2/ gains. In the special cases of zero-order (static) and plant-order antiwindup compensation, the feasibility conditions become (convex) linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that, if (and only if) the plant is asymptotically stable, plant-order linear antiwindup compensation is always feasible for large enough L/sub 2/ gain and that static antiwindup compensation is feasible provided a quasi-common Lyapunov function, between the open-loop and unconstrained closed-loop, exists. Using the solutions to the matrix feasibility problems, the synthesis of the antiwindup augmentation achieving the desired level of L/sub 2/ performance is then accomplished by solving an additional LMI.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.816965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231247","","Linear systems;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Optimal control;Linear feedback control systems;Automatic control;Stability;Nonlinear filters;Buildings","","465","2","33","IEEE","15 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several new sufficient conditions for ascertaining the existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of such recurrent neural networks are obtained by using the theory of topological degree and properties of nonsingular M-matrix, and constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals. The new criteria do not require the activation functions to be differentiable, bounded or monotone nondecreasing and the connection weight matrices to be symmetric. Some stability results from previous works are extended and improved.

By incorporating varactor diodes into the texture, we have built a tunable impedance surface, in which an applied bias voltage controls the resonance frequency, and the reflection phase. We can program the surface to create a tunable phase gradient, which can electronically steer a reflected beam over +/- 40/spl deg/ in two dimensions, for both polarizations.

It is well known that the distribution of face images, under a perceivable variation in viewpoint, illumination or facial expression, is highly nonlinear and complex. It is, therefore, not surprising that linear techniques, such as those based on principle component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), cannot provide reliable and robust solutions to those FR problems with complex face variations. In this paper, we propose a kernel machine-based discriminant analysis method, which deals with the nonlinearity of the face patterns' distribution. The proposed method also effectively solves the so-called ""small sample size"" (SSS) problem, which exists in most FR tasks. The new algorithm has been tested, in terms of classification error rate performance, on the multiview UMIST face database. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is able to achieve excellent performance with only a very small set of features being used, and its error rate is approximately 34% and 48% of those of two other commonly used kernel FR approaches, the kernel-PCA (KPCA) and the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA), respectively.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2002.806629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176132","","Face recognition;Kernel;Algorithm design and analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Error analysis;Lighting;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Pattern analysis;Testing","","452","","32","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, it was shown for the case of highway traffic that position-based routing approaches can very well deal with the high mobility of network nodes. However, baseline position-based routing has difficulties to handle two-dimensional scenarios with obstacles (buildings) and voids as it is the case for city scenarios. In this paper we analyze a position-based routing approach that makes use of the navigational systems of vehicles. By means of simulation we compare this approach with non-position-based ad hoc routing strategies (dynamic source routing and ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing). The simulation makes use of highly realistic vehicle movement patterns derived from Daimler-Chrysler's Videlio traffic simulator. While DSR's performance is limited due to problems with scalability and handling mobility, both AODV and the position-based approach show good performances with the position-based approach outperforming AODV.","","0-7803-7848-2","10.1109/IVS.2003.1212901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212901","","Routing;Ad hoc networks;Cities and towns;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Road transportation;Telecommunication traffic;Navigation;Traffic control;Scalability","","448","12","16","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compared the performance of the different implementations for a variety of pulse formats and systems, including higher order solitons, collisions of soliton pulses, a single-channel periodically stationary dispersion-managed soliton system, and chirped return to zero systems with single and multiple channels. We introduce a globally third-order accurate split-step scheme, in which a bound on the local error is used to select the step size. In many cases, this method is the most efficient when compared with commonly used step-size selection criteria, and it is robust for a wide range of systems providing a system-independent rule for choosing the step sizes. We find that a step-size selection method based on limiting the nonlinear phase rotation of each step is not efficient for many optical-fiber transmission systems, although it works well for solitons. We also tested a method that uses a logarithmic step-size distribution to bound the amount of spurious four-wave mixing. This method is as efficient as other second-order schemes in the single-channel dispersion-managed soliton system, while it is not efficient in other cases including multichannel simulations. We find that in most cases, the simple approach in which the step size is held constant is the least efficient of all the methods. Finally, we implemented a method in which the step size is inversely proportional to the largest group velocity difference between channels. This scheme performs best in multichannel optical communications systems for the values of accuracy typically required in most transmission simulations.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2003.808628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1190149","","Optimization methods;Nonlinear optics;Optical mixing;Optical solitons;Optical pulses;Differential equations;Nonlinear equations;Chirp;Robustness;Testing","","435","4","15","IEEE","7 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods.

The architecture benefits from various optimizations performed at three levels of abstraction in system design-namely LDPC code design, decoding algorithm, and decoder architecture. First, the interconnect complexity problem of current decoder implementations is mitigated by designing architecture-aware LDPC codes having embedded structural regularity features that result in a regular and scalable message-transport network with reduced control overhead. Second, the memory overhead problem in current day decoders is reduced by more than 75% by employing a new turbo decoding algorithm for LDPC codes that removes the multiple checkto-bit message update bottleneck of the current algorithm. A new merged-schedule merge-passing algorithm is also proposed that reduces the memory overhead of the current algorithm for low to moderate-throughput decoders. Moreover, a parallel soft-input-soft-output (SISO) message update mechanism is proposed that implements the recursions of the Balh-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm in terms of simple ""max-quartet"" operations that do not require lookup-tables and incur negligible loss in performance compared to the ideal case. Finally, an efficient programmable architecture coupled with a scalable and dynamic transport network for storing and routing messages is proposed, and a full-decoder architecture is presented. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed architecture attains a throughput of 1.92 Gb/s for a frame length of 2304 bits, and achieves savings of 89.13% and 69.83% in power consumption and silicon area over state-of-the-art, with a reduction of 60.5% in interconnect length.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.817545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255474","","Parity check codes;Decoding;Algorithm design and analysis;Memory architecture;Design optimization;Performance loss;Routing;Throughput;Energy consumption;Silicon","","432","84","24","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the ""health"" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems.

This magnetic saliency has the information about the rotor position. The high-frequency voltage signal is injected into the motor in order to detect the magnetic saliency and estimate the rotor position.

These models use a set of scenarios and corresponding probabilities to model the multivariate random data process (electrical load, stream flows to hydro units, and fuel and electricity prices). For most practical problems the optimization problem that contains all possible scenarios is too large. Due to computational complexity and to time limitations this program is often approximated by a model involving a (much) smaller number of scenarios. The proposed reduction algorithms determine a subset of the initial scenario set and assign new probabilities to the preserved scenarios. The scenario tree construction algorithms successively reduce the number of nodes of a fan of individual scenarios by modifying the tree structure and by bundling similar scenarios.

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence supporting the role of OO design complexity metrics, specifically a subset of the Chidamber and Kemerer (1991, 1994) suite (CK metrics), in determining software defects. Our results, based on industry data from software developed in two popular programming languages used in OO development, indicate that, even after controlling for the size of the software, these metrics are significantly associated with defects. In addition, we find that the effects of these metrics on defects vary across the samples from two programming languages-C++ and Java.

Algebraic soft-decision decoding is achieved by means of converting the probabilistic reliability information into a set of interpolation points, along with their multiplicities. The proposed conversion procedure is shown to be asymptotically optimal for a certain probabilistic model. The resulting soft-decoding algorithm significantly outperforms both the Guruswami-Sudan decoding and the generalized minimum distance (GMD) decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, while maintaining a complexity that is polynomial in the length of the code. Asymptotic analysis for alarge number of interpolation points is presented, leading to a geo- metric characterization of the decoding regions of the proposed algorithm. It is then shown that the asymptotic performance can be approached as closely as desired with a list size that does not depend on the length of the code.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.819332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246007","","Decoding;Reed-Solomon codes;Interpolation;Maintenance;Algorithm design and analysis;Information theory;Computer science;Wireless communication;Modulation coding;Constellation diagram","","422","39","32","IEEE","17 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, rather than approximating the individual components as piecewise linear and then composing hundreds of components to make a system with exponentially many different linear regions, we instead generate a small set of linearizations about the state trajectory which is the response to a ""training input."" Computational results and performance data are presented for an example of a micromachined switch and selected nonlinear circuits. These examples demonstrate that the macromodels obtained with the proposed reduction algorithm are significantly more accurate than models obtained with linear or recently developed quadratic reduction techniques. Also, we propose a procedure for a posteriori estimation of the simulation error, which may be used to determine the accuracy of the extracted trajectory piecewise-linear reduced-order models. Finally, it is shown that the proposed model order reduction technique is computationally inexpensive, and that the models can be constructed ""on the fly,"" to accelerate simulation of the system response.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2002.806601","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174092","","Piecewise linear techniques;Circuit simulation;Nonlinear circuits;Reduced order systems;Switches;Computational modeling;Nonlinear systems;Piecewise linear approximation;Switching circuits;Acceleration","","415","10","25","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this distribution, a test statistic for equality of two such matrices and an associated asymptotic probability for obtaining a smaller value of the test statistic are derived and applied successfully to change detection in polarimetric SAR data. In a case study, EMISAR L-band data from April 17, 1998 and May 20, 1998 covering agricultural fields near Foulum, Denmark are used.

Proceedings.","15 Jul 2003","2003","2","","II","II","A new algorithm is proposed for removing large objects from digital images. The challenge is to fill in the hole that is left behind in a visually plausible way. In the past, this problem has been addressed by two classes of algorithms: (i) ""texture synthesis"" algorithms for generating large image regions from sample textures, and (ii) ""inpainting"" techniques for filling in small image gaps. The former work well for ""textures"" - repeating two dimensional patterns with some stochasticity; the latter focus on linear ""structures"" which can be thought of as one dimensional patterns, such as lines and object contours. This paper presents a novel and efficient algorithm that combines the advantages of these two approaches. We first note that exemplar-based texture synthesis contains the essential process required to replicate both texture and structure; the success of structure propagation, however, is highly dependent on the order in which the filling proceeds. We propose a best-first algorithm in which the confidence in the synthesized pixel values is propagated in a manner similar to the propagation of information in inpainting. The actual color values are computed using exemplar-based synthesis. Computational efficiency is achieved by a block-based sampling process. A number of examples on real and synthetic images demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in removing large occluding objects as well as thin scratches. Robustness with respect to the shape of the manually selected target region is also demonstrated. Our results compare favorably to those obtained by existing techniques.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211538","","Filling;Image restoration;Digital images;Image generation;Computational efficiency;Image sampling;Robustness;Shape;Humans;Sampling methods","","414","46","23","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scattering signal observed in multifrequency passive microwave data is used to detect snow cover. Wet snow, frozen ground, precipitation, and other anomalous scattering signals are screened using established methods. The results from two different approaches (a simple time and continentwide static approach and a space and time dynamic approach) to estimating snow depth were compared. The static approach, based on radiative transfer calculations, assumes a temporally constant grain size and density. The dynamic approach assumes that snowpack properties are spatially and temporally dynamic and requires two simple empirical models of density and snowpack grain radius evolution, plus a dense media radiative transfer model based on the quasicrystalline approximation and sticky particle theory. To test the approaches, a four-year record of daily snow depth measurements at 71 meteorological stations plus passive microwave data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager, land cover data and a digital elevation model were used. In addition, testing was performed for a global dataset of over 1000 World Meteorological Organization meteorological stations recording snow depth during the 2000-2001 winter season. When compared with the snow depth data, the new algorithm had an average error of 23 cm for the one-year dataset and 21 cm for the four-year dataset (131% and 94% relative error, respectively). More importantly, the dynamic algorithm tended to underestimate the snow depth less than the static algorithm. This approach will be developed further and implemented for use with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System aboard Aqua.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.809118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196041","","Snow;Prototypes;Meteorology;Particle scattering;Testing;Microwave theory and techniques;Instruments;Grain size;Microwave measurements;Image sensors","","413","","9","IEEE","29 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in an undergraduate electromagnetics syllabus, an introduction to the topic of circular polarization is necessary to promote an understanding of the propagation aspects of modern communications system design. Students new to the antennas and propagation discipline often have difficulty in grasping the concept of CP; therefore, in this paper, the essential aspects of this topic are reinforced by a tutorial description of CP in terms of wave propagation, antenna properties, and measurement techniques. A simple laboratory-based project is described that requires the design, fabrication, and measurement of a crossed dipole antenna. The measured input impedance and radiation patterns are correlated with theory to highlight the conditions necessary to support CP wave propagation. By combining basic electromagnetic concepts with a series of simple intuitive laboratory experiments, the students can more easily visualize, and hence understand, CP wave propagation and its use in communications systems design.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2003.813519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220729","","Satellite communication;Polarization;Electromagnetic propagation;Communication engineering education;Antennas;Impedance measurement","","411","","14","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results obtained show that some chaotic sequences are always able to increase the value of some measured algorithm-performance indexes with respect to random sequences.

For the problem of detecting deterministic signals in additive Gaussian noise, we show that having a set of identical binary sensors is asymptotically optimal, as the number of observations per sensor goes to infinity. Thus, the gain offered by having more sensors exceeds the benefits of getting detailed information from each sensor.

The neural networks have an additive interconnecting structure and they include as particular cases the Hopfield neural networks (HNNs), and the standard cellular neural networks (CNNs), in the limiting situation where the HNNs and CNNs possess neurons with infinite gain. Conditions are derived which ensure the existence of a unique equilibrium point, and a unique output equilibrium point, which are globally attractive for the state and the output trajectories of the neural network, respectively. These conditions, which are applicable to general nonsymmetric neural networks, are based on the concept of Lyapunov diagonally-stable neuron interconnection matrices, and they can be thought of as a generalization to the discontinuous case of previous results established for neural networks possessing smooth neuron activations. Moreover, by suitably exploiting the presence of sliding modes, entirely new conditions are obtained which ensure global convergence in finite time, where the convergence time can be easily estimated on the basis of the relevant neural-network parameters. The analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. In particular, global convergence is addressed by using a Lyapunov-like approach based on the concept of monotone trajectories of a differential inclusion.","1558-1268","","10.1109/TCSI.2003.818614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242840","","Convergence;Neural networks;Neurons;Cellular neural networks;Symmetric matrices;Hopfield neural networks;Differential equations;Diodes;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Kernel","","407","","30","IEEE","3 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such mismatches may frequently occur in practical situations because of violation of underlying assumptions on the environment, sources, or sensor array. This is especially true when the desired signal components are present in the beamformer ""training"" data snapshots because in this case, the adaptive array performance is very sensitive to array and model imperfections. The similar phenomenon of performance degradation can occur even when the array response to the desired signal is known exactly, but the training sample size is small. We propose a new powerful approach to robust adaptive beamforming in the presence of unknown arbitrary-type mismatches of the desired signal array response. Our approach is developed for the most general case of an arbitrary dimension of the desired signal subspace and is applicable to both the rank-one (point source) and higher rank (scattered source/fluctuating wavefront) desired signal models. The proposed robust adaptive beamformers are based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and data covariance matrix as well as worst-case performance optimization. Simple closed-form solutions to the considered robust adaptive beamforming problems are derived. Our new beamformers have a computational complexity comparable with that of the traditional adaptive beamforming algorithms, while, at the same time, offer a significantly improved robustness and faster convergence rates.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.815395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223538","","Robustness;Array signal processing;Adaptive arrays;Sensor arrays;Degradation;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Training data;Scattering;Uncertainty;Covariance matrix","","404","3","46","IEEE","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method can realize a new master-slave manipulator system that uses no mechanical master controller. A person whose forearm has been amputated can use this manipulator as a personal assistant for desktop work. The control system consists of a hand and wrist control part and an arm control part. The hand and wrist control part selects an active joint in the manipulator's end-effector and controls it based on EMG pattern discrimination. The arm control part measures the position of the operator's wrist joint or the amputated part using a three-dimensional position sensor, and the joint angles of the manipulator's arm, except for the end-effector part, are controlled according to this position, which, in turn, corresponds to the position of the manipulator's joint. These control parts enable the operator to control the manipulator intuitively. The distinctive feature of our system is to use a novel statistical neural network for EMG pattern discrimination. The system can adapt itself to changes of the EMG patterns according to the differences among individuals, different locations of the electrodes, and time variation caused by fatigue or sweat. Our experiments have shown that the developed system could learn and estimate the operator's intended motions with a high degree of accuracy using the EMG signals, and that the manipulator could be controlled smoothly. We also confirmed that our system could assist the amputee in performing desktop work.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2003.808873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192150","","Electromyography;Manipulators;Control systems;Wrist;Master-slave;Position measurement;Neural networks;Electrodes;Fatigue;Motion estimation","","400","39","43","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although designed as a technical demonstration for land applications, Hyperion was tested for its capabilities over a range of water targets in Eastern Australia, including Moreton Bay in southern Queensland. Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties, apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality parameters. Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field. A matrix inversion method was applied to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended matter, which were comparable to those estimated in the field on the days of the overpass.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.812907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220246","","Satellites;Hyperspectral sensors;Remote sensing;Sea measurements;Optical sensors;Optical noise;Australia;Spatial resolution;Testing;Earth","","395","1","22","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a feedforward MP-point tracking scheme is developed for the coupled-inductor interleaved-boost-converter-fed PV system using a fuzzy controller. The proposed converter has lower switch current stress and improved efficiency over the noncoupled converter system. For a given solar insolation, the tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point. This is done by the feedforward loop, which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage corresponding to the MP point. Depending on the error and change of error signals, the fuzzy controller generates a control signal for the pulsewidth-modulation generator which in turn adjusts the duty ratio of the converter. The reference voltage corresponding to the MP point for the feedforward loop is obtained by an offline trained neural network. Experimental data are used for offline training of the neural network, which employs a backpropagation algorithm. The proposed peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results. Tracking performance of the proposed controller is also compared with the conventional proportional-plus-integral-controller-based system. These studies reveal that the fuzzy controller results in better tracking performance.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2003.814762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215479","","Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Control systems;Voltage;Solar power generation;Signal generators;Switching converters;Switches;Error correction;Pulse generation","","395","4","18","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method adapts itself to various types of image noise as well as to the preference of the medical expert; a single parameter can be used to balance the preservation of (expert-dependent) relevant details against the degree of noise reduction. The algorithm exploits generally valid knowledge about the correlation of significant image features across the resolution scales to perform a preliminary coefficient classification. This preliminary coefficient classification is used to empirically estimate the statistical distributions of the coefficients that represent useful image features on the one hand and mainly noise on the other. The adaptation to the spatial context in the image is achieved by using a wavelet domain indicator of the local spatial activity. The proposed method is of low complexity, both in its implementation and execution time. The results demonstrate its usefulness for noise suppression in medical ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In these applications, the proposed method clearly outperforms single-resolution spatially adaptive algorithms, in terms of quantitative performance measures as well as in terms of visual quality of the images.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.809588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199634","","Wavelet domain;Filtration;Biomedical imaging;Noise reduction;Noise robustness;Filtering;Spatial resolution;Image resolution;Statistical distributions;Magnetic noise","Algorithms;Brain;Computer Simulation;Heart;Humans;Image Enhancement;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Stochastic Processes;Ultrasonography;User-Computer Interface","391","1","40","IEEE","21 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The linear feedback part is designed to yield a closed-loop system with a small damping ratio for a quick response, while at the same time not exceeding the actuator limits for the desired command input levels. The nonlinear feedback law is used to increase the damping ratio of the closed-loop system as the system output approaches the target reference to reduce the overshoot caused by the linear part. It is shown that the proposed technique is capable of beating the well-known time-optimal control in the asymptotic tracking situations. The application of such a new technique to an actual hard disk drive servo system shows that it outperforms the conventional method by more than 30%.

It needs to record details of what it produces in terms of concrete information. Business artifacts are a mechanism to record this information in units that are concrete, identifiable, self-describing, and indivisible. We developed the concept of artifacts, or semantic objects, in the context of a technique for constructing formal yet intuitive operational descriptions of a business. This technique, called OpS (Operational Specification), was developed over the course of many business-transformation and business-process-integration engagements for use in IBM's internal processes as well as for use with customers. Business artifacts (or business records) are the basis for the factorization of knowledge that enables the OpS technique. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of business artifacts—what they are, how they are represented, and the role they play in operational business modeling. Unlike the more familiar and popular concept of business objects, business artifacts are pure instances rather than instances of a taxonomy of types. Consequently, the key operation on business artifacts is recognition rather than classification.","0018-8670","","10.1147/sj.423.0428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386806","","","","386","7","","","6 Apr 2010","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The mapping is in general not injective; that is, a computational unit may contribute to several features. Our technique allows for the distinction between general and specific computational units with respect to a given set of features. For a set of features, it also identifies jointly and distinctly required computational units. The presented technique combines dynamic and static analyses to rapidly focus on the system's parts that relate to a specific set of features. Dynamic information is gathered based on a set of scenarios invoking the features. Rather than assuming a one-to-one correspondence between features and scenarios as in earlier work, we can now handle scenarios that invoke many features.

Multihop cellular networks and networks with energy constraints are studied as special cases. With slight modifications, the developed formulation can handle node mobility and time-varying flat-fading channels. Numerical results indicate that multihop routing, the ability for concurrent transmissions, and SIC significantly increase the capacity of ad hoc and multihop cellular networks. On the other hand, gains from power control are significant only when variable-rate transmission is not used. Also, time-varying flat-fading and node mobility actually improve the capacity.

To reflect this expanded scope, the broader terms ""microfluidics"" and ""lab-on-a-chip"" are now often used in addition to μTAS. Most microfluidics researchers rely on micromachining technologies at least to some extent to produce microflow systems based on interconnected micrometer-dimensioned channels. As members of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) community know, however, one can do more with these techniques. It is possible to impart higher levels of functionality by making features in different materials and at different levels within a microfluidic device. Increasingly, researchers have considered how to integrate electrical or electrochemical function into chips for purposes as diverse as heating, temperature sensing, electrochemical detection, and pumping.

This new approach is intended to reduce the number of generations required for convergence to the optimum. Reducing the number of generations, i.e., the time complexity of the algorithm, is important if a large population size is desired: (1) to reduce the effect of noise; (2) to improve global search properties; and (3) to implement the algorithm on (highly) parallel machines. Our method results in a highly parallel algorithm which scales favorably with large numbers of processors. This is accomplished by efficiently incorporating the available information from a large population, thus significantly reducing the number of generations needed to adapt the covariance matrix. The original version of the CMA-ES was designed to reliably adapt the covariance matrix in small populations but it cannot exploit large populations efficiently. Our modifications scale up the efficiency to population sizes of up to 10n, where n is the problem dimension. This method has been applied to a large number of test problems, demonstrating that in many cases the CMA-ES can be advanced from quadratic to linear time complexity.","1063-6560","","10.1162/106365603321828970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790790","Evolution strategy;derandomized self-adaptation;covariance matrix adaptation;evolution path;parallelization","","","384","2","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Geometric deformable models implemented using level set methods have advantages over parametric models due to their intrinsic behavior, parameterization independence, and ease of implementation. However, a long claimed advantage of geometric deformable models-the ability to automatically handle topology changes-turns out to be a liability in applications where the object to be segmented has a known topology that must be preserved. We present a new class of geometric deformable models designed using a novel topology-preserving level set method, which achieves topology preservation by applying the simple point concept from digital topology. These new models maintain the other advantages of standard geometric deformable models including subpixel accuracy and production of nonintersecting curves or surfaces. Moreover, since the topology-preserving constraint is enforced efficiently through local computations, the resulting algorithm incurs only nominal computational overhead over standard geometric deformable models. Several experiments on simulated and real data are provided to demonstrate the performance of this new deformable model algorithm.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1201824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201824","","Topology;Level set;Deformable models;Parametric statistics;Solid modeling;Image segmentation;Brain;Production;Computational modeling;Active contours","","381","4","60","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a general epidemic threshold condition that applies to arbitrary graphs: we prove that, under reasonable approximations, the epidemic threshold for a network is closely related to the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, for the last question, we show that infections tend to zero exponentially below the epidemic threshold. We show that our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi, BA power-law, homogeneous); we show that the threshold tends to zero for infinite power-law graphs.

Information hiding is an emerging research area which encompasses applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, fingerprinting, steganography, and data embedding. In these applications, information is hidden within a host data set and is to be reliably communicated to a receiver. The host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert way, designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Next, an attacker may seek to destroy this hidden information, and for this purpose, introduce additional distortion to the data set. Side information (in the form of cryptographic keys and/or information about the host signal) may be available to the information hider and to the decoder. We formalize these notions and evaluate the hiding capacity, which upper-bounds the rates of reliable transmission and quantifies the fundamental tradeoff between three quantities: the achievable information-hiding rates and the allowed distortion levels for the information hider and the attacker. The hiding capacity is the value of a game between the information hider and the attacker. The optimal attack strategy is the solution of a particular rate-distortion problem, and the optimal hiding strategy is the solution to a channel-coding problem. The hiding capacity is derived by extending the Gel'fand-Pinsker (1980) theory of communication with side information at the encoder. The extensions include the presence of distortion constraints, side information at the decoder, and unknown communication channel. Explicit formulas for capacity are given in several cases, including Bernoulli and Gaussian problems, as well as the important special case of small distortions. In some cases, including the last two above, the hiding capacity is the same whether or not the decoder knows the host data set. It is shown that many existing information-hiding systems in the literature operate far below capacity.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.808134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184136","","Information analysis;Decoding;Copyright protection;Watermarking;Fingerprint recognition;Steganography;RAKE receivers;Cryptography;Rate-distortion;Communication channels","","380","1","59","IEEE","10 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This helps reduce the number of processing hops on the delivery path to a client while avoiding network bottleneck. Consequently, the end-to-end delay is kept small. Although one could build a tree satisfying such properties easily, an efficient control protocol between the nodes must be in place to maintain the tree under the effects of network dynamics and unpredictable client behaviors.

However, motors driven by solid-state inverters undergo severe voltage stresses due to rapid switch-on and switch-off of semiconductor switches. Also, induction motors are required to operate in highly corrosive and dusty environments. Requirements such as these have spurred the development of vastly improved insulation material and treatment processes. But cage rotor design has undergone little change. As a result, rotor failures now account for a larger percentage of total induction motor failures. Broken cage bars and bearing deterioration are now the main cause of rotor failures. Moreover, with advances in digital technology over the last years, adequate data processing capability is now available on cost-effective hardware platforms, to monitor motors for a variety of abnormalities on a real time basis in addition to the normal motor protection functions. Such multifunction monitors are now starting to displace the multiplicity of electromechanical devices commonly applied for many years. For such reasons, this paper is devoted to a comparison of signal processing-based techniques for the detection of broken bars and bearing deterioration in induction motors. Features of these techniques which are relevant to fault detection are presented. These features are then analyzed and compared to deduce the most appropriate technique for induction motor rotor fault detection.","1558-0059","","10.1109/TEC.2003.811741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201095","","Induction motors;Rotors;Fault diagnosis;Bars;Condition monitoring;Fault detection;Semiconductor device manufacture;Stator windings;Solid state circuits;Inverters","","377","3","21","IEEE","28 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose to use the multipoint control protocol defined by the IEEE 802.3ah task force to arbitrate the transmission of different users, and we present different dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithms to allocate bandwidths effectively and fairly between end users. These DBA algorithms are also augmented to support differentiated services, a crucial requirement for a converged broadband access network with heterogeneous traffic.

We investigated the effect of sleep stages and sleep apnea on autonomic activity by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Since spectral analysis is suited for the identification of cyclical variations and detrended fluctuation analysis can analyze the scaling behavior and detect long-range correlations, we compared the results of both complementary techniques in 14 healthy subjects, 33 patients with moderate, and 31 patients with severe sleep apnea. The spectral parameters VLF, LF, HF, and LF/HF confirmed increasing parasympathetic activity from wakefulness and REM over light sleep to deep sleep, which is reduced in patients with sleep apnea. Discriminance analysis was used on a person and sleep stage basis to determine the best method for the separation of sleep stages and sleep apnea severity. Using spectral parameters 69.7% of the apnea severity assignments and 54.6% of the sleep stage assignments were correct, while using scaling analysis these numbers increased to 74.4% and 85.0%, respectively.

We present a power-control framework called utility-based power control (UBPC) by reformulating the problem using a softened SIR requirement (utility) and adding a penalty on power consumption (cost). Under this framework, the goal is to maximize the net utility, defined as utility minus cost. Although UBPC is still noncooperative and distributed in nature, some degree of cooperation emerges: a user will automatically decrease its target SIR (and may even turn off transmission) when it senses that traffic congestion is building up. This framework enables us to improve system convergence and to satisfy heterogeneous service requirements (such as delay and bit error rate) for integrated networks with both voice users and data users. Fairness, adaptiveness, and a high degree of flexibility can be achieved by properly tuning parameters in UBPC.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.810314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194818","","Wireless cellular systems;Power control;Energy consumption;Costs;Distributed algorithms;Robust stability;Wireless networks;Resource management;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","","372","1","24","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is shown that in order to achieve an optimal cost-distortion tradeoff, the source and the channel have to be matched in a probabilistic sense.

Closed-form necessary and sufficient expressions relating the above entities are given. This generalizes both the separation-based approach as well as the two well-known examples of optimal uncoded communication. The condition of probabilistic matching is extended to certain nonergodic and multiuser scenarios.

Hyperion can provide effective measures of agricultural performance through the use of established spectral indexes if systematic and random noise is managed. The noise management strategy includes recognition of ""bad"" pixels, reducing the effects of vertical striping, and compensation for atmospheric effects in the data. It also aims to reduce compounding of these effects by image processing. As the noise structure is different for Hyperion's two spectrometers, noise reduction methods are best applied to each separately. Results show that a local destriping algorithm reduces striping noise without introducing unwanted effects in the image. They also show how data smoothing can clean the data and how careful selection of stable Hyperion bands can minimize residual atmospheric effects following atmospheric correction. Comparing hyperspectral indexes derived from Hyperion with the same indexes derived from ground-measured spectra allowed us to assess some of these impacts on the preprocessing options. It has been concluded that preprocessing, which includes fixing bad and outlier pixels, local destriping, atmospheric correction, and minimum noise fraction smoothing, provides improved results. If these or equivalent preprocessing steps are followed, it is feasible to develop a consistent and standardized time series of data that is compatible with field-scale and airborne measured indexes. Red-edge and leaf chlorophyll indexes based on the preprocessed data are shown to distinguish different levels of stress induced by water restrictions.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220232","","Hyperspectral imaging;Noise reduction;Atmospheric measurements;Smoothing methods;Agriculture;Irrigation;Australia;Noise measurement;Image processing;Spectroscopy","","361","6","35","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed tool can be easily applied to determine the optimum charging time as function of the existing load, ambient temperature, and time of day. From the study, it can be deduced that direct connect-and-charge scheme can be detrimental to the transformer life, especially under high temperature and large load.

Our algorithm is based on a novel application of one-way function trees. In comparison with the top-down logical key hierarchy (LKH) method of Wallner et al., our bottom-up algorithm approximately halves the number of bits that need to be broadcast to members in order to rekey after a member is added or evicted. The number of keys stored by group members, the number of keys broadcast to the group when new members are added or evicted, and the computational efforts of group members, are logarithmic in the number of group members. Among the hierarchical methods, OFT is the first to achieve an approximate halving in broadcast length, an idea on which subsequent algorithms have built. Our algorithm provides complete forward and backward security: Newly admitted group members cannot read previous messages, and evicted members cannot read future messages, even with collusion by arbitrarily many evicted members. In addition, and unlike LKH, our algorithm has the option of being member contributory in that members can be allowed to contribute entropy to the group key. Running on a Pentium II, our prototype has handled groups with up to 10 million members. This algorithm offers a new scalable method for establishing group session keys for secure large-group applications such as broadcast encryption, electronic conferences, multicast sessions, and military command and control.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1199073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199073","","Satellite broadcasting;Cryptography;TV broadcasting;Security;Multicast algorithms;Conference management;Project management;Radio broadcasting;Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy","","359","8","60","IEEE","21 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper shows the development of branch-line and rat-race couplers that use artificial transmission lines (ATLs) in place of conventional transmission lines resulting in significant size reduction. As the ATLs are constructed entirely from microstriplines, the couplers are easily fabricated using conventional printed-circuit processes. The design formulas developed for the ATLs are explicit. Full-wave simulation and experimental results were used to confirm the design approach for hybrids operating at 1.8 GHz. The frequency response of the proposed hybrids is similar to conventional hybrids.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.817442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234753","","Microstrip;Couplers;Distributed parameter circuits;Planar transmission lines;Transmission line theory;Transmission lines;Coupling circuits;Transistors;MMICs;Space technology","","359","2","26","IEEE","7 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors review the total dose, single-event effects, and dose rate hardness of SOI devices. The total dose response of SOI devices is more complex than for bulk-silicon devices due to the buried oxide. Radiation-induced trapped charge in the buried oxide can increase the leakage current of partially depleted transistors and decrease the threshold voltage and increase the leakage current of fully depleted transistors. Process techniques that reduce the net amount of radiation-induced positive charge trapped in the buried oxide and device design techniques that mitigate the effects of trapped charge in the buried oxide have been developed to harden SOI devices to bulk-silicon device levels. The sensitive volume for charge collection in SOI technologies is much smaller than for bulk-silicon devices potentially making SOI devices much harder to single-event upset (SEU). However, bipolar amplification caused by floating body effects can significantly reduce the SEU hardness of SOI devices. Body ties are used to reduce floating body effects and improve SEU hardness. SOI ICs are completely immune to classic four-layer p-n-p-n single-event latchup; however, floating body effects make SOI ICs susceptible to single-event snapback (single transistor latch). The sensitive volume for dose rate effects is typically two orders of magnitude lower for SOI devices than for bulk-silicon devices. By using body ties to reduce bipolar amplification, much higher dose rate upset levels can be achieved for SOI devices than for bulk-silicon devices.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2003.812930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208574","","Radiation effects;Single event upset;Silicon on insulator technology;Isolation technology;Space technology;Leakage current;Laboratories;Threshold voltage;Immune system;Dielectrics","","358","8","93","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a new segmentation method combining some of their benefits. Our main intuition is that any cut on a graph embedded in some continuous space can be interpreted as a contour (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D). We show how to build a grid graph and set its edge weights so that the cost of cuts is arbitrarily close to the length (area) of the corresponding contours (surfaces) for any anisotropic Riemannian metric. There are two interesting consequences of this technical result. First, graph cut algorithms can be used to find globally minimum geodesic contours (minimal surfaces in 3D) under arbitrary Riemannian metric for a given set of boundary conditions. Second, we show how to minimize metrication artifacts in existing graph-cut based methods in vision. Theoretically speaking, our work provides an interesting link between several branches of mathematics -differential geometry, integral geometry, and combinatorial optimization.

In WMNs, similar to ad hoc networks, each user node operates not only as a host but also as a router; user packets are forwarded to and from an Internet-connected gateway in multihop fashion. The meshed topology provides good reliability, market coverage, and scalability, as well as low upfront investments. Despite the recent startup surge in WMNs, much research remains to be done before WMNs realize their full potential. This article tackles the problem of determining the exact capacity of a WMN. The key concept we introduce to enable this calculation is the bottleneck collision domain, defined as the geographical area of the network that bounds from above the amount of data that can be transmitted in the network. We show that for WMNs the throughput of each node decreases as O(1/n), where n is the total number of nodes in the network. In contrast with most existing work on ad hoc network capacity, we do not limit our study to the asymptotic case. In particular, for a given topology and the set of active nodes, we provide exact upper bounds on the throughput of any node. The calculation can be used to provision the network, to ensure quality of service and fairness. The theoretical results are validated by detailed simulations.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2003.1241089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241089","","Wireless mesh networks;IP networks;Ad hoc networks;Network topology;Throughput;Spread spectrum communication;Scalability;Investments;Surges;Upper bound","","357","5","15","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The proposed framework combines space-time layering concepts with algebraic component codes optimized for single-input-single-output (SISO) channels. Each component code is assigned to a ""thread"" in the space-time matrix, allowing it thus full access to the channel spatial diversity in the absence of the other threads. Diophantine approximation theory is then used in order to make the different threads ""transparent"" to each other. Within this framework, a special class of signals which uses algebraic number-theoretic constellations as component codes is thoroughly investigated. The lattice structure of the proposed number-theoretic codes along with their minimal delay allow for polynomial complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding using algorithms from lattice theory. Combining the design framework with the Cayley transform allows to construct full diversity differential and noncoherent space-time codes. The proposed framework subsumes many of the existing codes in the literature, extends naturally to time-selective and frequency-selective channels, and allows for more flexibility in the tradeoff between power efficiency, bandwidth efficiency, and receiver complexity.

This paper proposes a new adaptive imaging technique that uses the generalized coherence factor (GCF) to reduce the focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. The GCF is derived from the spatial spectrum of the received aperture data after proper receive delays have been applied. It is defined as the ratio of the spectral energy within a prespecified low-frequency range to the total energy. It is demonstrated that the low-frequency component of the spectrum corresponds to the coherent portion of the received data, and that the high-frequency component corresponds to the incoherent portion. Hence, the GCF reduces to the coherence factor defined in the literature if the prespecified low-frequency range is restricted to DC only. In addition, the GCF is also an index of the focusing quality and can be used as a weighting factor for the reconstructed image. The efficacy of the GCF technique is demonstrated for focusing errors resulting from the sound-velocity inhomogeneities. Simulations and real ultrasound data are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed GCF technique. The characteristics of the GCF, including the effects of the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels, are also discussed. The GCF technique also is compared with the correlation-based technique and the parallel adaptive receive compensation algorithm; the improvement in image quality obtained with the proposed technique rivals that of the latter technique. In the presence of a displaced phase screen, this proposed technique also outperforms the correlation-based technique. Computational complexity and implementation issues also are addressed.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2003.1182117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1182117","","Focusing;Degradation;Spatial resolution;Acoustic imaging;Apertures;Delay;Image reconstruction;Ultrasonic imaging;Signal to noise ratio;Image quality","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Simulation;Cysts;Feedback;Humans;Image Enhancement;Models, Biological;Phantoms, Imaging;Quality Control;Scattering, Radiation;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Transducers;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography","353","7","18","IEEE","28 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is then obvious that, although these analyses provide evidence of brain activity changes prior to epileptic seizures, they cannot be applied to develop implantable devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this paper, we describe an adaptive procedure to prospectively analyze continuous, long-term EEG recordings when only the occurring time of the first seizure is known. The algorithm is based on the convergence and divergence of short-term maximum Lyapunov exponents (STLmax) among critical electrode sites selected adaptively. A warning of an impending seizure is then issued. Global optimization techniques are applied for selecting the critical groups of electrode sites. The adaptive seizure prediction algorithm (ASPA) was tested in continuous 0.76 to 5.84 days intracranial EEG recordings from a group of five patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. A fixed parameter setting applied to all cases predicted 82% of seizures with a false prediction rate of 0.16/h. Seizure warnings occurred an average of 71.7 min before ictal onset. Similar results were produced by dividing the available EEG recordings into half training and testing portions. Optimizing the parameters for individual patients improved sensitivity (84% overall) and reduced false prediction rate (0.12/h overall). These results indicate that ASPA can be applied to implantable devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.810689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198251","","Epilepsy;Biomedical engineering;Electroencephalography;Systems engineering and theory;Neuroscience;Medical diagnostic imaging;Chaos;Brain;Electrodes;Testing","Algorithms;Brain Mapping;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;False Positive Reactions;Feedback;Frontal Lobe;Hippocampus;Humans;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Seizures;Seizures;Sensitivity and Specificity;Temporal Lobe","350","39","44","IEEE","13 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The theory is used to consider DEP trapping, electrorotation, traveling-wave induced motion, and orientational effects. The effective dipole method, and its generalization to effective multipoles, makes it possible to treat multilayered concentric shells and particles exhibiting ohmic and dielectric loss. This method may be extended further to the case of nonspherical particles, where alignment torques can be considered.

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner. The system has been deployed on a wide variety of platforms including Sony's Aibo pet robot, ATR's RoboVie, and CU animator, and is currently being evaluated for applications including automatic reading tutors, assessment of human-robot interaction.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624313","","Face;Real time systems;Robots;Pixel;Training;Support vector machines;Gabor filters","","349","3","15","IEEE","12 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce a fast incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) algorithm, called candid covariance-free IPCA (CCIPCA), used to compute the principal components of a sequence of samples incrementally without estimating the covariance matrix (so covariance-free). The new method is motivated by the concept of statistical efficiency (the estimate has the smallest variance given the observed data). To do this, it keeps the scale of observations and computes the mean of observations incrementally, which is an efficient estimate for some well known distributions (e.g., Gaussian), although the highest possible efficiency is not guaranteed in our case because of unknown sample distribution. The method is for real-time applications and, thus, it does not allow iterations. It converges very fast for high-dimensional image vectors.

The algorithm searches for the peak power by varying the speed in the desired direction. The generator is operated in the speed control mode with the speed reference being dynamically modified in accordance with the magnitude and direction of change of active power. The peak power points in the P-/spl omega/ curve correspond to dP/d/spl omega/=0. This fact is made use of in the optimum point search algorithm. The generator considered is a wound rotor induction machine whose stator is connected directly to the grid and the rotor is fed through back-to-back pulse-width-modulation (PWM) converters. Stator flux-oriented vector control is applied to control the active and reactive current loops independently. The turbine characteristics are generated by a DC motor fed from a commercial DC drive. All of the control loops are executed by a single-chip digital signal processor (DSP) controller TMS320F240.

Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique.

To achieve good generalization, it is necessary to control the ""complexity"" of the learned function. In Bayesian approaches, this is done by adopting a prior for the parameters of the function being learned. We propose a Bayesian approach to supervised learning, which leads to sparse solutions; that is, in which irrelevant parameters are automatically set exactly to zero. Other ways to obtain sparse classifiers (such as Laplacian priors, support vector machines) involve (hyper)parameters which control the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers; these parameters have to be somehow adjusted/estimated from the training data. In contrast, our approach does not involve any (hyper)parameters to be adjusted or estimated. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes interpretation of the Laplacian prior, which is then modified by the adoption of a Jeffreys' noninformative hyperprior. Implementation is carried out by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments with several benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method outperforms SVMs and performs competitively with the best alternative techniques, although it involves no tuning or adjustment of sparseness-controlling hyperparameters.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1227989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227989","","Supervised learning;Bayesian methods;Training data;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Automatic control;Laplace equations;Kernel;Neural networks;Feedforward neural networks","","341","3","32","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first half of the paper deals with constructions using field extensions of /spl Qopf/. Working with cyclotomic field extensions, we construct several families of STBCs over a wide range of signal sets that are of full rank, minimal delay, and rate at least one appropriate for any number of transmit antennas. We study the coding gain and capacity of these codes. Using transcendental extensions we construct arbitrary rate codes that are full rank for arbitrary number of antennas. We also present a method of constructing STBCs using noncyclotomic field extensions. In the later half of the paper, we discuss two ways of embedding noncommutative division algebras into matrices: left regular representation, and representation over maximal cyclic subfields. The 4/spl times/4 real orthogonal design is obtained by the left regular representation of quaternions. Alamouti's (1998) code is just a special case of the construction using representation over maximal cyclic subfields and we observe certain algebraic uniqueness characteristics of it. Also, we discuss a general principle for constructing cyclic division algebras using the nth root of a transcendental element and study the capacity of the STBCs obtained from this construction. Another family of cyclic division algebras discovered by Brauer (1933) is discussed and several examples of STBCs derived from each of these constructions are presented.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237138","","Block codes;Algebra;Information theory;Transmitting antennas;Global communication;Symmetric matrices;Delay;Quaternions;Mutual information;Wireless communication","","340","15","46","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Reducing the run-time complexity of multiobjective EAs: The NSGA-II and other algorithms","M. T. Jensen","EVALife Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark",IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation,"14 Oct 2003","2003","7","5","503","515","The last decade has seen a surge of research activity on multiobjective optimization using evolutionary computation and a number of well performing algorithms have been published. The majority of these algorithms use fitness assignment based on Pareto-domination: Nondominated sorting, dominance counting, or identification of the nondominated solutions. The success of these algorithms indicates that this type of fitness is suitable for multiobjective problems, but so far the use of Pareto-based fitness has lead to program run times in O(GMN/sup 2/), where G is the number of generations, M is the number of objectives, and N is the population size. The N/sup 2/ factor should be reduced if possible, since it leads to long processing times for large population sizes. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for nondominated sorting, which can speed up the processing time of some multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) substantially. The new algorithm is incorporated into the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and reduces the overall run-time complexity of this algorithm to O(GN log/sup M-1/N), much faster than the O(GMN/sup 2/) complexity published by Deb et al. (2002). Experiments demonstrate that the improved version of the algorithm is indeed much faster than the previous one. The paper also points out that multiobjective EAs using fitness based on dominance counting and identification of nondominated solutions can be improved significantly in terms of running time by using efficient algorithms known from computer science instead of inefficient O(MN/sup 2/) algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.817234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237166","","Runtime;Evolutionary computation;Sorting;Computer science;Surges;Genetic algorithms;Data structures;Nearest neighbor searches;Heuristic algorithms;Councils","","339","","28","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we use modeling, measurements, and simulations to better characterize the interaction between probing packets and the competing network traffic. We first construct a simple model to understand how competing traffic changes the probing packet gap for a single-hop network. The gap model shows that the initial probing gap is a critical parameter when using packet pairs to estimate available bandwidth. Based on this insight, we present two available bandwidth measurement techniques, the initial gap increasing (IGI) method and the packet transmission rate (PTR) method. We use extensive Internet measurements to show that these techniques estimate available bandwidth faster than existing techniques such as Pathload, with comparable accuracy. Finally, using both Internet measurements and ns simulations, we explore how the measurement accuracy of active probing is affected by factors such as the probing packet size, the length of probing packet train, and the competing traffic on links other than the tight link.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.814505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217275","","Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;IP networks;Internet;Measurement techniques;Length measurement;Size measurement;Computerized monitoring;Computer science","","338","5","27","IEEE","4 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based on B-splines. An information theoretic measure, normalized mutual information, is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure. Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint, which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible for small deformations and short time periods. The incompressibility constraint is implemented by penalizing deviations of the Jacobian determinant of the deformation from unity. We apply the nonrigid registration algorithm with and without the incompressibility constraint to precontrast and postcontrast magnetic resonance (MR) breast images from 17 patients. Without using a constraint, the volume of contrast-enhancing lesions decreases by 1%-78% (mean 26%). Image improvement (motion artifact reduction) obtained using the new constraint is compared with that obtained using a smoothness constraint based on the bending energy of the coordinate grid by blinded visual assessment of maximum intensity projections of subtraction images. For both constraints, volume preservation improves, and motion artifact correction worsens, as the weight of the constraint penalty term increases. For a given volume change of the contrast-enhancing lesions (2% of the original volume), the incompressibility constraint reduces motion artifacts better than or equal to the smoothness constraint in 13 out of 17 cases (better in 9, equal in 4, worse in 4). The preliminary results suggest that incorporation of the incompressibility regularization term improves intensity-based free-form nonrigid registration of contrast-enhanced MR breast images by greatly reducing the problem of shrinkage of contrast-enhancing structures while simultaneously allowing motion artifacts to be substantially reduced.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.814791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211202","","Breast;Lesions;Deformable models;Spline;Mutual information;Performance evaluation;Cost function;Biological tissues;Jacobian matrices;Magnetic resonance","Adolescent;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Artifacts;Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged;Motion;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Single-Blind Method;Subtraction Technique","334","7","52","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These drawbacks can often be-at least partially-overcome by carrying out measurements on a subset of image pixels corresponding to natural or artificial stable reflectors [permanent scatterers (PS)] and exploiting long temporal series of interferometric data. This approach allows one to push the measurement precision very close to its theoretical limit (in the order of /spl sim/1 mm for C-band European Remote Sensing (ERS)-like sensors).

First, we develop a model for representing inter- and intra-die variations and their spatial correlations. Using this model, we then show how gate delays and arrival times can be represented as a sum of components, such that the correlation information between arrival times and gate delays is preserved. We then show how arrival times are propagated and merged in the circuit to obtain an arrival time distribution that is an upper bound on the distribution of the exact circuit delay. We prove the correctness of the bound and also show how the bound can be improved by propagating multiple arrival times. The proposed algorithms were implemented and tested on a set of benchmark circuits under several process variation scenarios. The results were compared with Monte Carlo simulation and show an accuracy of 3.32% on average over all test cases.","","1-58113-762-1","10.1109/ICCAD.2003.159781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1257914","","Timing;Circuit testing;Semiconductor process modeling;Performance analysis;Delay effects;Doping;Permission;Distribution functions;Circuit analysis computing;Distributed computing","","332","18","20","","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Jin et al., (2001)], [E. Knorr et al., (2000)]. We propose a new method for evaluating outlierness, which we call the local correlation integral (LOCI). As with the best previous methods, LOCI is highly effective for detecting outliers and groups of outliers (a.k.a. micro-clusters). In addition, it offers the following advantages and novelties: (a) It provides an automatic, data-dictated cutoff to determine whether a point is an outlier-in contrast, previous methods force users to pick cut-offs, without any hints as to what cut-off value is best for a given dataset. (b) It can provide a LOCI plot for each point; this plot summarizes a wealth of information about the data in the vicinity of the point, determining clusters, micro-clusters, their diameters and their inter-cluster distances. None of the existing outlier-detection methods can match this feature, because they output only a single number for each point: its outlierness score, (c) Our LOCI method can be computed as quickly as the best previous methods, (d) Moreover, LOCI leads to a practically linear approximate method, aLOCI (for approximate LOCI), which provides fast highly-accurate outlier detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use approximate computations to speed up outlier detection. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show that LOCI and aLOCI can automatically detect outliers and micro-clusters, without user-required cut-offs, and that they quickly spot both expected and unexpected outliers.","","0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260802","","Data engineering","","332","2","23","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is then shown that a properly designed dipole-DNG shell combination increases the real power radiated by more than an order of magnitude over the corresponding free space case. The reactance of the antenna is shown to have a corresponding decrease. Analysis of the reactive power within this dipole-DNG shell system indicates that the DNG shell acts as a natural matching network for the dipole. An equivalent circuit model is introduced that confirms this explanation. Several cases are presented to illustrate these results. The difficult problem of interpreting the energy stored in this dipole-DNG shell system when the DNG medium is frequency independent and, hence, of calculating the radiation Q is discussed from several points of view.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2003.817561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236081","","Dipole antennas;Magnetic materials;Antenna theory;Dielectric materials;Power system modeling;Frequency;Permittivity;Permeability;Dielectric substrates;Circuits","","331","4","22","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When embedded software reaches the complexity typical of today's designs, the risk that the software will not function correctly increases exponentially. The Metropolis project seeks to develop a unified framework that can cope with this challenge. Based on a metamodel with formal semantics that developers can use to capture designs, Metropolis provides an environment for complex electronic-system design that supports simulation, formal analysis, and synthesis.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2003.1193228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193228","","Algorithm design and analysis;Embedded software;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Formal verification;Computer architecture;Hardware;Solids;Uncertainty;Software design","","329","3","12","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This property is obtained by implicitly including a low-pass filter in the control loop. This leads to a closed-loop characteristic quasipolynomial of retarded type, and not one of neutral type, which was shown to be a cause of instability in previous schemes.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.820147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254091","","Control systems;Equations;Distributed control;Delay systems;Stability;Low pass filters;Delay effects;State feedback;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Mathematical model","","329","","20","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Microwave images are maps of the electrical property distributions in the body. The electrical properties of various tissues may be related to their physiological state. For example, the properties of tissues change with temperature. One application of microwave imaging that has been proposed is monitoring hyperthermia, which is the application of heat to tissue. In this case, the changing electrical properties indicate the successful deposition of heat in the tissue of interest. Other changes in electrical properties may be caused by disease. There is some evidence of changes in the properties of cancerous tissues when compared to normal tissues. Cancer detection with microwave imaging is based on this contrast in electrical properties.

Then, we use the SCGM to propose a new method to measure the degree of similarity between generalized fuzzy numbers. The proposed similarity measure uses the SCGM to calculate the COG points of trapezoidal or triangular generalized fuzzy numbers and then to calculate the degree of similarity between generalized fuzzy numbers. We also prove some properties of the proposed similarity measure and use an example to compare the proposed method with the existing similarity measures. The proposed similarity measure can overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods. We also apply the proposed similarity measure to develop a new method to deal with fuzzy risk analysis problems. The proposed fuzzy risk analysis method is more flexible and more intelligent than the existing methods due to the fact that it considers the degrees of confidence of decisionmakers' opinions.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.806316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178065","","Risk analysis;Gravity;Vectors;Equations;Decision making;Councils;Computer science;Arithmetic","","329","","37","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, all possible bendings of a given surface that includes all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1233902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233902","","Multidimensional systems;Histograms;Shape measurement;Level measurement;Surface texture;Computer graphics;Biomedical imaging;Image texture analysis;Computer errors;Robustness","","328","12","37","IEEE","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this survey, the problem-solving paradigm of ACO is explicated and compared to traditional routing algorithms along the issues of routing information, routing overhead and adaptivity. The contributions of this survey include 1) providing a comparison and critique of the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating stagnation (a major problem in many ACO algorithms), 2) surveying and comparing three major research in applying ACO in routing and load-balancing, and 3) discussing new directions and identifying open problems. The approaches for mitigating stagnation discussed include: evaporation, aging, pheromone smoothing and limiting, privileged pheromone laying and pheromone-heuristic control. The survey on ACO in routing/load-balancing includes comparison and critique of ant-based control and its ramifications, AntNet and its extensions, as well as ASGA and SynthECA.

The objectives are in conflict since the improvement of one of them leads to the deterioration of another. Instead of a unique optimal solution, it exists a set of best tradeoffs between competing objectives, the so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. A specially tailored nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) for a PMU placement problem is proposed as a methodology to find these Pareto-optimal solutions. The algorithm is combined with the graph-theoretical procedure and a simple GA to reduce the initial number of the PMU's candidate locations. The NSGA parameters are carefully set by performing a number of trial runs and evaluating the NSGA performances based on the number of distinct Pareto-optimal solutions found in the particular run and distance of the obtained Pareto front from the optimal one. Illustrative results on the 39- and 118-bus IEEE systems are presented.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2002.807064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178767","","Sorting;Genetic algorithms;Phasor measurement units;Observability;Voltage;Performance evaluation;Tree graphs;Monitoring;Control systems","","323","","12","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We examine the vector case as a special case, where the heuristic reduces to an iterative l/sub 1/-norm minimization technique.

Based on these results, a simple defect model is proposed that can explain the complex behavior of the V/sub T/ instability in terms of structural defects as follows. 1) A defect band in the HfO/sub 2/ layer is located in energy above the Si conduction band edge. 2) The defect band shifts rapidly in energy with respect to the Fermi level in the Si substrate as the gate bias is varied. 3) The rapid energy shifts allows for efficient charging and discharging of the defects near the SiO/sub 2//HfO/sub 2/ interface by tunneling.","1558-0563","","10.1109/LED.2003.808844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196025","","Threshold voltage;Hafnium oxide;Current measurement;Dielectric measurements;CMOS technology;Stability;Capacitance measurement;Charge pumps;Stress;Charge measurement","","322","1","9","IEEE","29 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus is on the case where there is no channel state information at the transmitter, but channel state information is assumed at the receiver. It is shown that the optimum signaling is sometimes different from cases where the users do not interfere with each other. In particular, the optimum signaling will sometimes put all power into a single transmitting antenna, rather than divide power equally between independent streams from the different antennas. If the interference is either sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong, we show that either the optimum interference-free approach, which puts equal power into each antenna, or the approach that puts all power into a single antenna is optimum and we show how to find the regions where each approach is best.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203164","","MIMO;Channel state information;Transmitters;Interchannel interference;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Covariance matrix;Rayleigh channels;Fading;Antenna arrays","","321","2","18","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By adjusting the NRI-medium lumped element values, the phase shift can be tailored to a given specification. Periodic analysis is applied to the structure and design equations are presented for the determination of the lumped element parameters for any arbitrary phase shift. To validate the design, various phase shifters are simulated and tested in coplanar waveguide (CPW) technology. It is demonstrated that small variations in the NRI-medium lumped element values can produce positive, negative or 0/spl deg/ phase shifts while maintaining the same short overall length. Thus, the new phase shifter offers some significant advantages over conventional delay lines: it is more compact in size, it exhibits a linear phase response around the design frequency, it can incur a phase lead or lag which is independent of the length of the structure and it exhibits shorter group delays.","1548-5757","","10.1109/LAWP.2003.815280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214903","","Metamaterials;Phase shifters;Coplanar waveguides;Refractive index;Transmission lines;Capacitors;Inductors;Periodic structures;Equations;Testing","","321","3","8","IEEE","23 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since wireless nodes are energy constrained, it may not be in the best interest of a node to always accept relay requests. On the other hand, if all nodes decide not to expend energy in relaying, then network throughput will drop dramatically. Both these extreme scenarios (complete cooperation and complete noncooperation) are inimical to the interests of a user. In this paper we address the issue of user cooperation in ad hoc networks. We assume that nodes are rational, i.e., their actions are strictly determined by self interest, and that each node is associated with a minimum lifetime constraint. Given these lifetime constraints and the assumption of rational behavior, we are able to determine the optimal throughput that each node should receive. We define this to be the rational Pareto optimal operating point. We then propose a distributed and scalable acceptance algorithm called generous tit-for-tat (GTFT).

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian-based algorithm within the framework of wavelet analysis, which reduces speckle in SAR images while preserving the structural features and textural information of the scene. First, we show that the subband decompositions of logarithmically transformed SAR images are accurately modeled by alpha-stable distributions, a family of heavy-tailed densities. Consequently, we exploit this a priori information by designing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. We use the alpha-stable model to develop a blind speckle-suppression processor that performs a nonlinear operation on the data and we relate this nonlinearity to the degree of non-Gaussianity of the data. Finally, we compare our proposed method to current state-of-the-art soft thresholding techniques applied on real SAR imagery and we quantify the achieved performance improvement.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221775","","Image denoising;Bayesian methods;Speckle;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar scattering;Wavelet analysis;Image analysis;Image texture analysis;Information analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","","320","1","40","IEEE","18 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The probabilistic gossip schemes studied so far typically assume that each group member has full knowledge of the global membership and chooses gossip targets uniformly at random. The requirement of global knowledge impairs their applicability to very large-scale groups. In this paper, we present SCAMP (Scalable Membership protocol), a novel peer-to-peer membership protocol which operates in a fully decentralized manner and provides each member with a partial view of the group membership. Our protocol is self-organizing in the sense that the size of partial views naturally converges to the value required to support a gossip algorithm reliably. This value is a function of the group size, but is achieved without any node knowing the group size. We propose additional mechanisms to achieve balanced view sizes even with highly unbalanced subscription patterns. We present the design, theoretical analysis, and a detailed evaluation of the basic protocol and its refinements. Simulation results show that the reliability guarantees provided by SCAMP are comparable to previous schemes based on global knowledge. The scale of the experiments attests to the scalability of the protocol.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2003.1176982","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176982","","Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication network reliability;Multicast protocols;Subscriptions;Large-scale systems;Internet;Computer crashes;Knowledge management","","318","5","27","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, small and subtle targets can be uncovered and extracted from image scenes, which may not be identified by prior knowledge. In particular, when target size is smaller than pixel resolution, target recognition must be carried out at subpixel level. Under such circumstance, traditional spatial-based image processing techniques are generally not applicable and may not perform well if they are applied. The work presented here investigates this issue and develops spectral-based algorithms for automatic spectral target recognition (ASTR) in hyperspectral imagery with no required a priori knowledge, specifically, in reconnaissance and surveillance applications. The proposed ASTR consists of two stage processes, automatic target generation process (ATGP) followed by target classification process (TCP). The ATGP generates a set of targets from image data in an unsupervised manner which will subsequently be classified by the TCP. Depending upon how an initial target is selected in ATGP, two versions of the ASTR can be implemented, referred to as desired target detection and classification algorithm (DTDCA) and automatic target detection and classification algorithm (ATDCA). The former can be used to search for a specific target in unknown scenes while the latter can be used to detect anomalies in blind environments. In order to evaluate their performance, a comparative and quantitative study using real hyperspectral images is conducted for analysis.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1261124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261124","","Target recognition;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Spatial resolution;Layout;Object detection;Classification algorithms;Remote sensing;Instruments;Image resolution","","318","1","19","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Non-CRF inhibition is exhibited by 80% of the orientation-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex of monkeys and has been shown to influence human visual perception as well. Essentially, the response of an edge detector at a certain point is suppressed by the responses of the operator in the region outside the supported area. We combine classical edge detection with isotropic and anisotropic inhibition, both of which have counterparts in biology. We also use a biologically motivated method (the Gabor energy operator) for edge detection. The resulting operator responds strongly to isolated lines, edges, and contours, but exhibits weak or no response to edges that are part of texture. We use natural images with associated ground truth contour maps to assess the performance of the proposed operator for detecting contours while suppressing texture edges. Our method enhances contour detection in cluttered visual scenes more effectively than classical edge detectors used in machine vision (Canny edge detector). Therefore, the proposed operator is more useful for contour-based object recognition tasks, such as shape comparison, than traditional edge detectors, which do not distinguish between contour and texture edges. Traditional edge detection algorithms can, however, also be extended with surround suppression. This study contributes also to the understanding of inhibitory mechanisms in biology.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.814250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212647","","Image edge detection;Detectors;Machine vision;Neurons;Humans;Visual perception;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Layout;Object recognition;Shape","","316","4","98","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Complex fuzzy logic is a generalization of traditional fuzzy logic, based on complex fuzzy sets. In complex fuzzy logic, inference rules are constructed and ""fired"" in a manner that closely parallels traditional fuzzy logic. The novelty of complex fuzzy logic is that the sets used in the reasoning process are complex fuzzy sets, characterized by complex-valued membership functions. The range of these membership functions is extended from the traditional fuzzy range of [0,1] to the unit circle in the complex plane, thus providing a method for describing membership in a set in terms of a complex number. Several mathematical properties of complex fuzzy sets, which serve as a basis for the derivation of complex fuzzy logic, are reviewed in this paper. These properties include basic set theoretic operations on complex fuzzy sets - namely complex fuzzy union and intersection, complex fuzzy relations and their composition, and a novel form of set aggregation - vector aggregation. Complex fuzzy logic is designed to maintain the advantages of traditional fuzzy logic, while benefiting from the properties of complex numbers and complex fuzzy sets. The introduction of complex-valued grades of membership to the realm of fuzzy logic generates a framework with unique mathematical properties, and considerable potential for further research and application.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2003.814832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220291","","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy set theory;Mathematical model;Humans;Decision making;Fuzzy control;Hybrid intelligent systems;Set theory","","315","","16","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several noniterative image reconstruction methods are used currently to compensate for field inhomogeneities, but these methods assume that the field map that characterizes the off-resonance frequencies is spatially smooth. Recently, iterative methods have been proposed that can circumvent this assumption and provide improved compensation for off-resonance effects. However, straightforward implementations of such iterative methods suffer from inconveniently long computation times. This paper describes a tool for accelerating iterative reconstruction of field-corrected MR images: a novel time-segmented approximation to the MR signal equation. We use a min-max formulation to derive the temporal interpolator. Speedups of around 60 were achieved by combining this temporal interpolator with a nonuniform fast Fourier transform with normalized root mean squared approximation errors of 0.07%. The proposed method provides fast, accurate, field-corrected image reconstruction even when the field map is not smooth.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194628","","Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Iterative methods;Biomedical engineering;Magnetic fields;Frequency;Image segmentation;Reconstruction algorithms;Optical imaging;Spirals","Algorithms;Brain;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Positron-Emission Tomography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Time Factors","314","19","50","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If a guided wave mode is dispersive, a pulse of energy will spread out in space and time as it propagates. For a long-range guided wave inspection application, this constrains the choice of operating point to regions on the dispersion curves where dispersion effects are small. A signal processing technique is presented that enables this constraint on operating point to be relaxed. The technique makes use of a priori knowledge of the dispersion characteristics of a guided wave mode to map signals from the time to distance domains. In the mapping process, dispersed signals are compressed to their original shape. The theoretical basis of the technique is described and an efficient numerical implementation is presented. The robustness of the technique to inaccuracies in the dispersion data is also addressed.

A hybrid network is formed by placing a sparse network of base stations in an ad hoc network. These base stations are assumed to be connected by a high-bandwidth wired network and act as relays for wireless nodes. They are not data sources nor data receivers. Hybrid networks present a tradeoff between traditional cellular networks and pure ad hoc networks in that data may be forwarded in a multihop fashion or through the infrastructure. It has been shown that the capacity of a random ad hoc network does not scale well with the number of nodes in the system. In this work, we consider two different routing strategies and study the scaling behavior of the throughput capacity of a hybrid network. Analytical expressions of the throughput capacity are obtained. For a hybrid network of n nodes and m base stations, the results show that if m grows asymptotically slower than √n, the benefit of adding base stations on capacity is insignificant. However, if m grows faster than √n, the throughput capacity increases linearly with the number of base stations, providing an effective improvement over a pure ad hoc network. Therefore, in order to achieve nonnegligible capacity gain, the investment in the wired infrastructure should be high enough.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208989","","Wireless networks;Ad hoc networks;Throughput;Base stations;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless LAN;Femtocell networks;Routing;Mobile ad hoc networks","","313","1","8","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, a number of methods have been proposed to solve this problem, one class of which involves maximizing a mutual information (Ml)-based objective function over a regular grid of splines. This approach has produced good results but its computational complexity is proportional to the compliance of the transformation required to register the smallest structures in the image. Here, we propose a method that permits the spatial adaptation of the transformation's compliance. This spatial adaptation allows us to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the overall transformation, thus speeding up the process and improving its convergence properties. To develop this method, we introduce several novelties: 1) we rely on radially symmetric basis functions rather than B-splines traditionally used to model the deformation field; 2) we propose a metric to identify regions that are poorly registered and over which the transformation needs to be improved; 3) we partition the global registration problem into several smaller ones; and 4) we introduce a new constraint scheme that allows us to produce transformations that are topologically correct.

The paper starts with a fundamental-physics analysis of the time-wavelength transformation and the implication of time dilation on the signal-to-noise ratio. A detailed mathematical description of the time-stretch process is then constructed. It elucidates the influence of linear and nonlinear optical dispersion on the fidelity of the electrical signal.

Furthermore, the vulnerability of the new approach to possible attacks is also assessed, and counter measures are suggested.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.812753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206706","","Steganography;Image analysis;Signal analysis;Robustness;Estimation error;Detection algorithms;Counting circuits;Art;Internet;Video sharing","","312","","5","IEEE","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By properly choosing the location and the size of the tuning stub, a wide impedance bandwidth of 60% can be obtained, which is about 1.9 times that of a conventional CPW-fed square slot antenna with a simple tuning stub.

It is based on a dual expression for channel capacity where the maximization (of mutual information) over distributions on the channel input alphabet is replaced with a minimization (of average relative entropy) over distributions on the channel output alphabet. We also propose a technique for the analysis of the asymptotic capacity of cost-constrained channels. The technique is based on the observation that under fairly mild conditions capacity achieving input distributions ""escape to infinity."" The above techniques are applied to multiple-antenna flat-fading channels with memory where the realization of the fading process is unknown at the transmitter and unknown (or only partially known) at the receiver. It is demonstrated that, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the capacity of such channels typically grows only double-logarithmically in the SNR. To better understand this phenomenon and the rates at which it occurs, we introduce the fading number as the second-order term in the high-SNR asymptotic expansion of capacity, and derive estimates on its value for various systems. It is suggested that at rates that are significantly higher than the fading number, communication becomes extremely power inefficient, thus posing a practical limit on practically achievable rates. Upper and lower bounds on the fading number are also presented. For single-input-single-output (SISO) systems the bounds coincide, thus yielding a complete characterization of the fading number for general stationary and ergodic fading processes. We also demonstrate that for memoryless multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels, the fading number is achievable using beam-forming, and we derive an expression for the optimal beam direction. This direction depends on the fading law and is, in general, not the direction that maximizes the SNR on the induced SISO channel. Using a new closed-form expression for the expectation of the logarithm of a noncentral chi-square distributed random variable we provide some closed-form expressions for the fading number of some systems with Gaussian fading, including SISO systems with circularly symmetric stationary and ergodic Gaussian fading. The fading number of the latter is determined by the fading mean, fading variance, and the mean squared error in predicting the present fading from its past; it is not directly related to the Doppler spread. For the Rayleigh, Ricean, and multiple-antenna Rayleigh-fading channels we also present firm (nonasymptotic) upper and lower bounds on channel capacity. These bounds are asymptotically tight in the sense that their difference from capacity approaches zero at high SNR, and their ratio to capacity approaches one at low SNR.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237131","","Fading;Rayleigh channels;Channel capacity;Closed-form solution;Upper bound;Mutual information;Entropy;H infinity control;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio","","306","3","38","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two components of the field flux are produced. One, which is almost constant, is produced by the permanent magnet located on the rotor surface. The other, which is variable, is produced by a field winding positioned circumferentially in the center of the stator. These two flux components converge in the air gap. The excitation level of the machine is manipulated by controlling the DC field current. Three-dimensional finite-element analysis and experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to vary the flux over a wide range to keep the terminal voltage constant as the speed increases.

Droop control is utilized to distribute the load between the source converters. In order to make the loading of the source converters equal, in per unit, the voltage control algorithm for each converter has to be designed to act similar. The DC side capacitor of each converter, needed for filtering, is also determined as a consequence. The root locus is investigated for varying DC bus impedance.

Second, we show that the estimation of n, based on exponential smoothing of the measured collision probability (specifically, an ARMA filter), results to be a biased estimation, with poor performance in terms of accuracy/tracking trade-offs. Third, we propose a methodology to estimate n, based on an extended Kalman filter coupled with a change detection mechanism.

The novelty of the IGF method comes from 1) the derivation of independent Gabor features in the feature extraction stage and 2) the development of an IGF features-based probabilistic reasoning model (PRM) classification method in the pattern recognition stage. In particular, the IGF method first derives a Gabor feature vector from a set of downsampled Gabor wavelet representations of face images, then reduces the dimensionality of the vector by means of principal component analysis, and finally defines the independent Gabor features based on the independent component analysis (ICA). The independence property of these Gabor features facilitates the application of the PRM method for classification. The rationale behind integrating the Gabor wavelets and the ICA is twofold. On the one hand, the Gabor transformed face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation selectivity. These images can, thus, produce salient local features that are most suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, ICA would further reduce redundancy and represent independent features explicitly. These independent features are most useful for subsequent pattern discrimination and associative recall. Experiments on face recognition using the FacE REcognition Technology (FERET) and the ORL datasets, where the images vary in illumination, expression, pose, and scale, show the feasibility of the IGF method. In particular, the IGF method achieves 98.5% correct face recognition accuracy when using 180 features for the FERET dataset, and 100% accuracy for the ORL dataset using 88 features.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.813829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215407","","Independent component analysis;Face recognition;Face detection;Principal component analysis;Wavelet analysis;Lighting;Image recognition;Computer science;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition","","304","3","52","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Jerk limitation is important in industrial robot applications, since it results in improved path tracking and reduced wear on the robot. The method described herein uses a concatenation of fifth-order polynomials to provide a smooth trajectory between two way points. The trajectory approximates a linear segment with parabolic blends trajectory. A sine wave template is used to calculate the end conditions (control points) for ramps from zero acceleration to nonzero acceleration. Joining these control points with quintic polynomials results in a controlled quintic trajectory that does not oscillate, and is near time optimal for the jerk and acceleration limits specified. The method requires only the computation of the quintic control points, up to a maximum of eight points per trajectory way point. This provides hard bounds for online motion algorithm computation time. A method for blending these straight-line trajectories over a series of way points is also discussed. Simulations and experimental results on an industrial robot are presented.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.807548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177163","","Trajectory;Polynomials;Manipulators;Service robots;Actuators;Acceleration;Torque;Optimal control;Motion planning;Robot motion","","304","8","21","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We empirically show that instances of the fixed-outline floorplan problem are significantly harder than related instances of classical floorplan problems. We suggest new objective functions to drive simulated annealing and new types of moves that better guide local search in the new context. Wirelength improvements and optimization of aspect ratios of soft blocks are explicitly addressed by these techniques. Our proposed moves are based on the notion of floorplan slack. The proposed slack computation can be implemented with all existing algorithms to evaluate sequence pairs, of which we use the simplest, yet semantically indistinguishable from the fastest reported . A similar slack computation is possible with many other floorplan representations. In all cases the computation time approximately doubles. Our empirical evaluation is based on a new floorplanner implementation Parquet-1 that can operate in both outline-free and fixed-outline modes. We use Parquet-1 to floorplan a design, with approximately 32000 cells, in 37 min using a top-down, hierarchical paradigm.","1557-9999","","10.1109/TVLSI.2003.817546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255486","","Shape;Simulated annealing;Pins;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Very large scale integration;Design automation;Application specific integrated circuits;Nonhomogeneous media;Routing","","304","5","29","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2003.1237173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237173","","Middleware;Mobile computing;Application software;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants;Context-aware services;Bandwidth;Batteries;Power engineering computing;Reflection","","304","6","36","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our analysis is based on determining the number of basic computational operations required by a decoder to perform the key decoding subfunctions. The frequency of use of each of the required decoding subfunctions is empirically derived using bitstreams generated from two different encoders for a variety of content, resolutions and bit rates. Using the measured frequencies, estimates of the decoder time complexity for various hardware platforms can be determined. A detailed example is provided to assist in deriving time complexity estimates. We compare the resulting estimates to numbers measured for an optimized decoder on the Pentium 3 hardware platform. We then use those numbers to evaluate the dependence of the time complexity of each of the major decoder subfunctions on encoder characteristics, content, resolution and bit rate. Finally, we compare an H.264/AVC-compliant baseline decoder to a decoder that is compliant with the H.263 standard, which is currently dominant in interactive video applications. Both ""C"" only decoder implementations were compared on a Pentium 3 hardware platform.

SLSP can be employed as a stand-alone protocol, or fit naturally into a hybrid routing framework, when combined with a reactive protocol.

BLDC and AC machines with concentrated windings usually have a slot pitch of only 2/3 the length of the pole pitch, which results in a poor fundamental winding factor of 0,866. This can be compared to the ideal winding factor of one, which can easily be acquired using distributed windings. However, by choosing better combinations of the pole and slot numbers for a machine with concentrated windings, the winding factor can be substantially increased. Moreover, it is also possible to achieve low cogging torque without skewing, simply by selecting appropriate combinations. The presented theory includes both single- and double-layer configurations of concentrated windings. The theory is verified by using FEM analysis.

This result indicates that, when n is large, even if each node is highly unreliable and the transmission power is small, we can still maintain connectivity with coverage. We also show that the diameter of the random grid (i.e., the maximum number of hops required to travel from any active node to another) is of the order √{n/log(n)}.

In this approach, one of the two conductors forming the PPW is replaced by an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) surface. The main advantage of the proposed approach over the commonly practiced methods is the omnidirectional noise suppression it provides. For this purpose, two EBG structures are initially designed by utilizing an approximate circuit model. Subsequently, the corresponding band structures are characterized by analytical solutions using the transverse resonance method, as well as full-wave finite-element simulations. The designed EBG surfaces were fabricated and employed in a number of PPW test boards. The corresponding frequency-domain measurements exhibited bandgaps of approximately 2.21 and 3.35 GHz in the frequency range below 6 GHz. More importantly, suppression of the PPW noise by 53% was achieved based on time-domain reflectometry experiments, while maintaining the signal transmission quality within the required specifications for common signaling standards.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.812555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201796","","Periodic structures;Circuit noise;Electromagnetic interference;Metamaterials;Electromagnetic waveguides;Printed circuits;Conductors;Resonance;Finite element methods;Analytical models","","302","22","16","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SDMs are built by performing a statistical analysis of the deformations required to map anatomical features in one subject into the corresponding features in another subject. The concept of SDMs is similar to statistical shape models (SSMs) which capture statistical information about shapes across a population, but offers several advantages over SSMs. First, SDMs can be constructed directly from images such as three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance (MR) or computer tomography volumes without the need for segmentation which is usually a prerequisite for the construction of SSMs. Instead, a nonrigid registration algorithm based on free-form deformations and normalized mutual information is used to compute the deformations required to establish dense correspondences between the reference subject and the subjects in the population class under investigation. Second, SDMs allow the construction of an atlas of the average anatomy as well as its variability across a population of subjects. Finally, SDMs take the 3-D nature of the underlying anatomy into account by analysing dense 3-D deformation fields rather than only information about the surface shape of anatomical structures. We show results for the construction of anatomical models of the brain from the MR images of 25 different subjects. The correspondences obtained by the nonrigid registration are evaluated using anatomical landmark locations and show an average error of 1.40 mm at these anatomical landmark positions. We also demonstrate that SDMs can be constructed so as to minimize the bias toward the chosen reference subject.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.815865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216225","","Brain modeling;Deformable models;Anatomy;Shape;Statistical analysis;Magnetic resonance;Tomography;Image segmentation;Mutual information;Information analysis","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Schizophrenia;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","300","11","29","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automated detection and quantitation of abnormal vascular tortuosity from three-dimensional (3-D) medical image data would, therefore, be of value. However, previous research has centered primarily upon two-dimensional (2-D) analysis of the special subset of vessels whose paths are normally close to straight. This report provides the first 3-D tortuosity analysis of clusters of vessels within the normally tortuous intracerebral circulation. We define three different clinical patterns of abnormal tortuosity. We extend into 3-D two tortuosity metrics previously reported as useful in analyzing 2-D images and describe a new metric that incorporates counts of minima of total curvature. We extract vessels from MRA data, map corresponding anatomical regions between sets of normal patients and patients with known pathology, and evaluate the three tortuosity metrics for ability to detect each type of abnormality within the region of interest. We conclude that the new tortuosity metric appears to be the most effective in detecting several types of abnormalities. However, one of the other metrics, based on a sum of curvature magnitudes, may be more effective in recognizing tightly coiled, ""corkscrew"" vessels associated with malignant tumors.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.816964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225850","","Diseases;Biomedical imaging;Two dimensional displays;Image analysis;Malignant tumors;Shape measurement;Associate members;Image recognition;Medical diagnostic imaging;Data mining","Brain;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Brain Neoplasms;Cerebral Angiography;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Angiography;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Neovascularization, Pathologic;Predictive Value of Tests;Severity of Illness Index","300","12","37","IEEE","4 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most laptops, handheld PCs, and cell phones use batteries that take anywhere from 1.5 to 4 hours to fully charge but can run on this charge for only a few hours.

To meet the stringent power budget of these devices, researchers have explored various architectural, hardware, software, and system-level optimizations to minimize the energy consumed per useful computation. Research in battery-aware optimization is now moving from stand-alone devices to networks of wireless devices, specifically, ad hoc and distributed sensor networks. Computationally feasible mathematical models are now available that capture battery discharge characteristics in sufficient detail to let designers develop an optimization strategy that extracts maximum charge.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2003.1250886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250886","","Batteries;Wireless sensor networks;Portable computers;Personal communication networks;Cellular phones;Energy management;Hardware;Software systems;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Mathematical model","","298","3","34","IEEE","19 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We first derive a matched-filter bound (MFB) for OFDM transmissions over doubly selective Rayleigh fading channels, which benchmarks the best possible performance if ICI is completely canceled without noise enhancement. We then derive universal performance bounds which show that the time-varying channel causes most of the symbol energy to be distributed over a few subcarriers, and that the ICI power on a subcarrier mainly comes from several neighboring subcarriers. Based on this fact, we develop low-complexity minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) receivers for ICI suppression. Simulations show that the DFE receiver can collect significant gains of ICI-impaired OFDM with affordable complexity. In the relatively low Doppler frequency region, the bit-error rate of the DFE receiver is close to the MFB.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.820752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256744","","Interference suppression;OFDM;Fading;Decision feedback equalizers;Frequency division multiplexing;Time-varying channels;Bit error rate;Degradation;Bandwidth;Narrowband","","297","15","33","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the case of the synchronous frame current regulator, the time delay is accompanied by a frame rotation. In some applications where the ratio of the sampling frequency to the output frequency is insufficient, such as a high-power drive or a super-high-speed drive, the effect of the frame rotation during the delay time causes a phase and magnitude error in the voltage output. The error degrades the dynamic performance and can cause instability in the current regulator at high speed. It is also intuitively known that advancing the phase of the voltage output can mitigate this instability. In this paper, the errors in the voltage output and the instability problems have been studied analytically and a compensation method for the error is proposed.

The TS fuzzy representation of a nonlinear system subject to actuator saturation is presented. In our TS fuzzy representation, the modeling error is also captured by norm-bounded uncertainties. A set invariance condition for the system in the TS fuzzy representation is first established. Based on this set invariance condition, the problem of estimating the domain of attraction of a TS fuzzy system under a constant state feedback law is formulated and solved as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem. By viewing the state feedback gain as an extra free parameter in the LMI optimization problem, we arrive at a method for designing state feedback gain that maximizes the domain of attraction. A fuzzy scheduling control design method is also introduced to further enlarge the domain of attraction. An inverted pendulum is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy controller.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.806317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1178066","","Robust stability;Control system analysis;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Nonlinear systems;Actuators;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy control;State feedback","","294","","28","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint.

A major difficulty that prevents application of the vast control literature developed for the serial counterparts to redundantly actuated parallel manipulators is the lack of an efficient dynamical model for real-time control. In this paper, using the Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation, we propose a simple scheme for computing the inverse dynamics of a redundantly actuated parallel manipulator. Based on this approach, four basic control algorithms, a joint-space proportional derivative (PD) control, a PD control in generalized coordinates, an augmented PD control, and a computed-torque control, are formulated. A two-degrees-of-freedom redundantly acutated parallel manipulator designed for a high-speed assembly task is used to verify the simplicity of the proposed approach and to evaulate the performance of the four control algorithms.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2003.820006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255402","","Manipulator dynamics;PD control;Proportional control;Lagrangian functions;Concurrent computing;Algorithm design and analysis;Assembly;Legged locomotion;Equations;Prototypes","","294","","14","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

According to the theory, the clustering problem is equivalent to finding convex polyhedral cones in the high-dimensional image space. To efficiently determine the conic structures hidden in the image data, we introduce the concept of conic affinity, which measures the likelihood of a pair of images belonging to the same underlying polyhedral cone. For the second method, we introduce another affinity measure based on image gradient comparisons. The algorithm operates directly on the image gradients by comparing the magnitudes and orientations of the image gradient at each pixel. Both methods have clear geometric motivations, and they operate directly on the images without the need for feature extraction or computation of pixel statistics. We demonstrate experimentally that both algorithms are surprisingly effective in clustering images acquired under varying illumination conditions with two large, well-known image data sets.","1063-6919","0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211332","","Lighting;Clustering algorithms;Computer vision;Computer science;Pixel;Image databases;Feature extraction;Statistics;Image converters;Cameras","","292","2","27","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method uses an integer linear program to determine new locations for the base stations and a flow-based routing protocol to ensure energy efficient routing during each round.

Algorithms have been proposed which use graph cuts or belief propagation for inference. These stereo algorithms differ in both the inference algorithm used and the formulation of the MRF. It is unknown whether to attribute the responsibility for differences in performance to the MRF or the inference algorithm. We address this through controlled experiments by comparing the belief propagation algorithm and the graph cuts algorithm on the same MRF's, which have been created for calculating stereo disparities. We find that the labellings produced by the two algorithms are comparable. The solutions produced by graph cuts have a lower energy than those produced with belief propagation, but this does not necessarily lead to increased performance relative to the ground truth.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238444","","Belief propagation;Inference algorithms;Stereo vision;Markov random fields;Computer vision;Pixel;Labeling;Testing;Computational efficiency;Costs","","291","5","16","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Web's growth has transformed communications and business services such that speed, accuracy, and availability of network-delivered content has become absolutely critical - both on their own terms and in terms of measuring Web performance. Proxy servers partially address the need for rapid content delivery by providing multiple clients with a shared cache location. In this context, if a requested object exists in a cache (and the cached version has not expired), clients get a cached copy, which typically reduces delivery time. CDNs act as trusted overlay networks that offer high-performance delivery of common Web objects, static data, and rich multimedia content by distributing content load among servers that are close to the clients. CDN benefits include reduced origin server load, reduced latency for end users, and increased throughput. CDNs can also improve Web scalability and disperse flash-crowd events.

These fingerprints are typically embedded into the content using watermarking techniques that are designed to be robust to a variety of attacks. A cost-effective attack against such digital fingerprints is collusion, where several differently marked copies of the same content are combined to disrupt the underlying fingerprints. We investigate the problem of designing fingerprints that can withstand collusion and allow for the identification of colluders. We begin by introducing the collusion problem for additive embedding. We then study the effect that averaging collusion has on orthogonal modulation. We introduce a tree-structured detection algorithm for identifying the fingerprints associated with K colluders that requires O(Klog(n/K)) correlations for a group of n users. We next develop a fingerprinting scheme based on code modulation that does not require as many basis signals as orthogonal modulation. We propose a new class of codes, called anti-collusion codes (ACCs), which have the property that the composition of any subset of K or fewer codevectors is unique. Using this property, we can therefore identify groups of K or fewer colluders. We present a construction of binary-valued ACC under the logical AND operation that uses the theory of combinatorial designs and is suitable for both the on-off keying and antipodal form of binary code modulation. In order to accommodate n users, our code construction requires only O(/spl radic/n) orthogonal signals for a given number of colluders. We introduce three different detection strategies that can be used with our ACC for identifying a suspect set of colluders. We demonstrate the performance of our ACC for fingerprinting multimedia and identifying colluders through experiments using Gaussian signals and real images.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.809378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188750","","Fingerprint recognition;Watermarking;Robustness;Modulation coding;Protection;Laboratories;Detection algorithms;Modular construction;Binary codes;Signal processing","","289","10","40","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we consider this problem for stationary networks, and we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the critical transmitting range for one-dimensional networks and nontight bounds for two and three-dimensional networks. Due to the presence of the geometric parameter l in the model, our results can be applied to dense as well as sparse ad hoc networks, contrary to existing theoretical results that apply only to dense networks. We also investigate several related questions through extensive simulations. First, we evaluate the relationship between the critical transmitting range and the minimum transmitting range that ensures formation of a connected component containing a large fraction (e.g., 90 percent) of the nodes. Then, we consider the mobile version of the problem, in which nodes are allowed to move during a time interval and the value of r ensuring connectedness for a given fraction of the interval must be determined. These results yield insight into how mobility affects connectivity and they also reveal useful trade offs between communication capability and energy consumption.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2003.1195149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195149","","Intelligent networks;Ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Wireless sensor networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Transceivers;Temperature sensors;Marine vehicles;Solid modeling","","289","","34","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of this, these methods have found limited application to clinical situations where fast execution is required, e.g., intraoperative imaging. This paper presents a parallel implementation of a nonrigid image registration algorithm. It takes advantage of shared-memory multiprocessor computer architectures using multithreaded programming by partitioning of data and partitioning of tasks, depending on the computational subproblem. For three different biomedical applications (intraoperative brain deformation, contrast-enhanced MR mammography, intersubject brain registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm is quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to perform the computation of intra-operative brain deformation in less than a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU shared-memory supercomputer (SGI Origin 3800). It is shown that its serial component is no more than 2% of the total computation time, allowing a speedup of at least a factor of 50. In most cases, the theoretical limit of the speedup is substantially higher (up to 132-fold in the application examples presented in this paper). The parallel implementation of our algorithm is, therefore, capable of solving nonrigid registration problems with short execution time requirements and may be considered an important step in the application of such techniques to clinically important problems such as the computation of brain deformation during cranial image-guided surgery.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2003.808506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186522","","Image registration;Breast;Application software;Partitioning algorithms;Biomedical computing;Computational efficiency;Biomedical imaging;Computer architecture;Mammography;Algorithm design and analysis","Algorithms;Animals;Bees;Brain;Breast;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","288","2","34","IEEE","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The transfer function method is presented as a tool to detect these displacements. In order to be able to evaluate the measurements, the correlation between the characteristics of transfer functions and possible damages must be known. Axial displacement and radial deformation of transformer windings have been studied in this research work using two test transformers. The primary winding of the first transformer for axial displacement has 31 double disk coils (1.3 MVA, 10 kV) and the secondary winding is a four layer winding. The second transformer for the study of radial deformation has 30 double disk coils (1.2 MVA, 10 kV) as primary winding and a one layer winding as secondary winding. The detailed mathematical models were developed for the test objects and a comparison was carried out between measured and calculated results. It is shown that this model can present the behavior of the transformer windings in the frequency domain in the case of sound and displaced conditions.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2003.809692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193870","","Transfer functions;Windings;Electromagnetic modeling;Power transformers;Oil insulation;Testing;Coils;Frequency domain analysis;Dissolved gas analysis;Power transmission","","287","","23","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This provides the crucial step in proving the next main result: The diversity order achievable through antenna selection is the same as that of the full system. The result sets up strong motivation for introducing receive selection in MIMO-SM systems. The remainder of the paper discusses selection algorithms for two popular MIMO-SM systems, namely, ordered successive interference cancellation with independently encoded layers and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver with joint encoding of data streams.

This study analyzes the performance enhancements made possible by improved timing as a function of the coincidence time resolution. If 500 ps FWHM coincidence timing resolution can be achieved in a complete PET camera, the following four benefits can be realized for whole-body FDG imaging: 1) the random event rate can be reduced by using a narrower coincidence timing window, increasing the peak NECR by /spl sim/50%; 2) using time-of-flight (TOF) in the reconstruction algorithm will reduce the noise variance by a factor of 5; 3) emission and transmission data can be acquired simultaneously, reducing the total scan time; and 4) axial blurring can be reduced by using TOF to determine the correct axial plane of origin for each event. While TOF was extensively studied in the 1980s, practical factors limited its effectiveness at that time and little attention has been paid to timing in PET since then. As these potential improvements are substantial and the advent of LSO PET cameras gives us the means to obtain them without other sacrifices, efforts to improve PET timing should resume after their long dormancy.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2003.817319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236927","","Positron emission tomography;Timing;Cameras;Biomedical imaging;Crystals;Geometry;Performance analysis;Image resolution;Whole-body PET;Reconstruction algorithms","","286","15","35","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applications of EGT with selection diversity combining, equal gain combining, and maximum ratio combining are addressed. It is proven that systems using EGT with any of these combining schemes achieve full diversity order when transmitting over a memoryless, flat-fading Rayleigh matrix channel with independent entries. Since, in practice, full channel knowledge at the transmitter is difficult to realize, a quantized version of EGT is proposed. An algorithm to construct a beamforming vector codebook that guarantees full diversity order is presented.

However, despite these benefits one important issue has received little attention throughout the ongoing discussion of texture based volume rendering: the integration of acceleration techniques to reduce per-fragment operations. In this paper, we address the integration of early ray termination and empty-space skipping into texture based volume rendering on graphical processing units (GPU). Therefore, we describe volume ray-casting on programmable graphics hardware as an alternative to object-order approaches. We exploit the early z-test to terminate fragment processing once sufficient opacity has been accumulated, and to skip empty space along the rays of sight.

The rate of an orthogonal design is defined as the ratio of the number of transmitted information symbols in a block of channel uses to the length of the given block, which reflects the bandwidth efficiency of the employed space-time block code constructed from the orthogonal design. This paper focuses on the analysis and synthesis of orthogonal designs with the maximum possible rates, which may be real or complex and square or rectangular matrices. We first provide several representations of orthogonal designs and their characterizations in terms of Hurwitz-Radon matrix equations. Next, we observe that the real orthogonal designs, square or rectangular, and the complex square orthogonal designs with maximal rates have been well understood from the existing results in the mathematics literature which can be dated back to 1890s. However, unfortunately, it is not the case for the complex rectangular orthogonal designs with rates as high as possible. We then construct a class of complex orthogonal designs for any number of transmit antennas. The proposed complex orthogonal designs for the number of transmit antennas n=2m-1 and 2m have the same rate m+1 and 2m, where m is any natural number. Finally, we demonstrate that, for n=2m-1 and 2m with any given natural number m, the value m+1 and 2m is the maximum possible rate that the complex orthogonal designs, square or rectangular, with n transmit antennas can achieve.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237132","","Block codes;Transmitting antennas;Algorithm design and analysis;Wireless communication;Maximum likelihood decoding;Bandwidth;Employment;Equations;Mathematics;Algebra","","285","","50","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a hierarchical model composed of continuous time-trigger components at the low level and discrete event-triggered components at the high level.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.814926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219474","","Distributed control;Communication system control;Application software;Algorithm design and analysis;Control theory;Delay effects;Jitter;Hardware;Computational modeling;Computer networks","","282","","47","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One major advantage of this approach over deterministic online security assessment is that it condenses contingency likelihood and severity into indices that reflect probabilistic risk. Use of these indices in control room decision making leads to increased understanding of potential network problems, including overload, cascading overload, low voltages, and voltage instability, resulting in improved security-related decision making.

Because of this interaction, we find that sensor networks are very data-centric.

Multiaccess signal interference is explicitly modeled. We use a duality approach whereby, as a byproduct of finding the optimal policy, we find the sensitivity of the minimal total average power with respect to the average data rate for each link. Since the minimal total average power is a convex function of the required minimum average data rates, shortest path algorithms with the link weights set to the link sensitivities can be used to guide the search for a globally optimum routing. We present a few simple examples that show our algorithm can find policies that support data rates that are not possible with conventional approaches.

To treat these phenomena, this paper presents a model based on the previously developed memory polynomial model. The contribution made in this paper is to augment the memory polynomial model to include a sparse delay tap structure that reduces the parameter space required for accurate model identification. A figure-of-merit, called the memory effect ratio, is defined to quantify the relative level of distortion due to memory effects, as compared to the memoryless portion. Another figure-of-merit is defined as the memory effect modeling ratio, which quantifies the degree to which the PA memory effects have been accounted for in the model. This new technique is validated using a variety of RF PAs, including an 880-MHz and a 2.1-GHz high-power laterally diffused metal-oxide semiconductor PA and various signals such as two-tone, eight-tone, and IS-95B signals.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.820155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1256782","","Radio frequency;Power amplifiers;Radiofrequency amplifiers;History;Polynomials;Power system modeling;Signal analysis;Nonlinear distortion;RF signals;Delay","","277","2","17","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gnutella, a popular file-sharing application, relies on flooding queries to all peers. Although flooding is simple and robust, it is not scalable. We explore how to retain the simplicity of Gnutella, while addressing its inherent weakness: scalability. We propose a content location solution in which peers loosely organize themselves into an interest-based structure on top of the existing Gnutella network. Our approach exploits a simple, yet powerful principle called interest-based locality, which posits that if a peer has a particular piece of content that one is interested in, it is very likely that it will have other items that one is interested in as well. When using our algorithm, called interest-based shortcuts, a significant amount of flooding can be avoided, making Gnutella a more competitive solution. In addition, shortcuts are modular and can be used to improve the performance of other content location mechanisms including distributed hash table schemes. We demonstrate the existence of interest-based locality in five diverse traces of content distribution applications, two of which are traces of popular peer-to-peer file-sharing applications. Simulation results show that interest-based shortcuts often resolve queries quickly in one peer-to-peer hop, while reducing the total load in the system by a factor of 3 to 7.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209237","","Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Scalability;Floods;Internet;Availability;Contracts;Content management;Costs;Engineering profession","","276","14","26","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our designs are based either on parameterizations of unitary matrices, or on algebraic number-theoretic constructions. With an arbitrary number of N/sub t/ transmit- and N/sub r/ receive-antennas, ST-LCP achieves rate 1 symbol/s/Hz and enjoys diversity gain as high as N/sub t/N/sub r/ over (possibly correlated) quasi-static and fast fading channels. As figures of merit, we use diversity and coding gains, as well as mutual information of the underlying multiple-input-multiple-output system. We show that over quadrature-amplitude modulation and pulse-amplitude modulation, our LCP achieves the upper bound on the coding gain of all linear precoders for certain values of N/sub t/ and comes close to this upper bound for other values of N/sub t/, in both correlated and independent fading channels. Compared with existing ST block codes adhering to an orthogonal design (ST-OD), ST-LCP offers not only better performance, but also higher mutual information for N/sub t/>2. For decoding ST-LCP, we adopt the near-optimum sphere-decoding algorithm, as well as reduced-complexity suboptimum alternatives. Although ST-OD codes afford simpler decoding, the tradeoff between performance and rate versus complexity favors the ST-LCP codes when N/sub t/, N/sub r/, or the spectral efficiency of the system increase. Simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2003.808970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184114","","Pulse modulation;Block codes;Fading;Mutual information;Modulation coding;Upper bound;Decoding;Matrices;Diversity methods;MIMO","","275","19","36","IEEE","10 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Live power measurements are imperative for studies requiring execution times too long for simulation, such as thermal analysis. Furthermore, as processors become more complex and include a host of aggressive dynamic power management techniques, per-component estimates of power dissipation have become both more challenging as well as more important. In this paper we describe our technique for a coordinated measurement approach that combines real total power measurement with performance-counter-based, per-unit power estimation. The resulting tool offers live total power measurements for Intel Pentium 4 processors, and also provides power breakdowns for 22 of the major CPU subunits over minutes of SPEC2000 and desktop workload execution.

Experimental results are provided to illustrate the improved performance of the nonlinear controllers over the simple PD controller.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2003.816822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232303","","Couplings;Nonlinear control systems;Control systems;Cranes;Payloads;Vehicle dynamics;Aerodynamics;Adaptive control;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Open loop systems","","275","","29","IEEE","23 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is defined as the modeling, analysis, and control of systems that involve the interaction of both discrete state systems, represented by finite automata, and continuous state dynamics, represented by differential equations. The embedded autopilot of a modern commercial jet is a prime example of a hybrid system: the autopilot modes correspond to the application of different control laws, and the logic of mode switching is determined by the continuous state dynamics of the aircraft, as well as through interaction with the pilot. To understand the behavior of hybrid systems, to simulate, and to control these systems, theoretical advances, analyses, and numerical tools are needed. In this paper, we first present a general model for a hybrid system along with an overview of methods for verifying continuous and hybrid systems. We describe a particular verification technique for hybrid systems, based on two-person zero-sum game theory for automata and continuous dynamical systems. We then outline a numerical implementation of this technique using level set methods, and we demonstrate its use in the design and analysis of aircraft collision avoidance protocols and in verification of autopilot logic.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2003.814621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215682","","Control system synthesis;Automatic control;Automata;Aircraft;Control theory;Computer science;Control system analysis;Differential equations;Control systems;Logic","","275","","82","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The trained ensemble is applied to each individual image to give the image multiple soft labels, and each label is associated with a label membership factor. To select a base binary-classifier for CBSA, we experiment with two learning methods, support vector machines (SVMs) and Bayes point machines (BPMs), and compare their class-prediction accuracy.

However, how to choose thresholds also poses a dilemma between reachability and efficiency under different host densities.

The proposed inverter system is composed of a half-bridge inverter at the utility interface and a novel generation control circuit which compensates for reductions in the output power of the system that are attributable to variations in the generation conditions of respective photovoltaic modules. The generation control circuit allows each photovoltaic module to operate independently at peak capacity, simply by detecting the output power of the system. Furthermore, the generation control circuit attenuates low-frequency ripple voltage, which is caused by the half-bridge inverter, across the photovoltaic modules. Consequently, the output power of the system is increased due to the increase in average power generated by the photovoltaic modules. The effectiveness of the proposed inverter system is confirmed experimentally and by means of simulation.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.809375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189622","","Photovoltaic systems;Solar power generation;Inverters;Power generation;Circuits;Power generation economics;Control systems;Voltage control;Urban areas;DC generators","","274","1","6","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Manual annotation is impractical and unscalable, and automatic annotation tools remain largely undeveloped. Specialized knowledge services therefore require tools that can search and extract specific knowledge directly from unstructured text on the Web, guided by an ontology that details what type of knowledge to harvest. An ontology uses concepts and relations to classify domain knowledge. Other researchers have used ontologies to support knowledge extraction, but few have explored their full potential in this domain. The paper considers the Artequakt project which links a knowledge extraction tool with an ontology to achieve continuous knowledge support and guide information extraction. The extraction tool searches online documents and extracts knowledge that matches the given classification structure. It provides this knowledge in a machine-readable format that will be automatically maintained in a knowledge base (KB). Knowledge extraction is further enhanced using a lexicon-based term expansion mechanism that provides extended ontology terminology.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2003.1179189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179189","","Ontologies;Data mining;Biographies;Semantic Web;Image databases;Painting;Web pages;Terminology;Image reconstruction;Assembly","","273","23","11","IEEE","4 Apr 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Spectral measurements over the near-infrared allow the sensing of subsurface tissue structure which is significantly different from person to person, but relatively stable over time. The local spectral properties of human tissue are nearly invariant to face orientation and expression which allows hyperspectral discriminants to be used for recognition over a large range of poses and expressions.

A nonunitary transform, based on the simultaneous diagonalization of the clean speech and noise covariance matrices, is used to project the noisy signal onto a signal-plus-noise subspace and a noise subspace. The clean signal is estimated by nulling the signal components in the noise subspace and retaining the components in the signal subspace. The applied transform has built-in prewhitening and can therefore be used in general for colored noise. The proposed approach is shown to be a generalization of the approach proposed by Y. Ephraim and H.L. Van Trees (see ibid., vol.3, p.251-66, 1995) for white noise. Two estimators are derived based on the nonunitary transform, one based on time-domain constraints and one based on spectral domain constraints.

Proper selection of the kernel bandwidth is, however, a critical step for superior space analysis and partitioning. This paper presents a mean shift-based approach for local bandwidth selection in the multimodal, multivariate case. The method is based on a fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. This paper demonstrates that, within the large sample approximation, the local covariance is estimated by the matrix that maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Using this property, the paper develops a reliable algorithm which takes into account the stability of local bandwidth estimates across scales.

The problem is formulated in the framework of linear inverse problem and the solution makes use of the singular value decomposition of the relevant operator. This allows us to properly take into account nonuniform orbit separation and to exploit a priori knowledge regarding the size of the volume interested by the scattering mechanism, thus leading to superresolution in the elevation direction. Results obtained on simulated data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed processing technique.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.809934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198642","","Layout;Azimuth;Electromagnetic scattering;Focusing;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar scattering;Radar tracking;Tomography;Image reconstruction;Radar imaging","","268","4","18","IEEE","13 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As these networks get deployed in a wide range of new applications, where power is becoming a key design constraint, we need to seriously consider power efficiency in designing interconnection networks. As the demand for network bandwidth increases, communication links, already a significant consumer of power now, will take up an ever larger portion of total system power budget. In this paper we motivate the use of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) for links, where the frequency and voltage of links are dynamically adjusted to minimize power consumption. We propose a history-based DVS policy that judiciously adjusts link frequencies and voltages based on past utilization. Our approach realizes up to 6.3/spl times/ power savings (4.6/spl times/ on average). This is accompanied by a moderate impact on performance (15.2% increase in average latency before network saturation and 2.5% reduction in throughput.)

The approach is to start from one or more initial, low-order estimates that are only accurate in small image regions, called bootstrap regions. In each bootstrap region, the algorithm iteratively: 1) refines the transformation estimate using constraints only from within the bootstrap region; 2) expands the bootstrap region; and 3) tests to see if a higher order transformation model can be used, stopping when the region expands to cover the overlap between images. Steps 1): and 3), the bootstrap steps, are governed by the covariance matrix of the estimated transformation. Estimation refinement [Step 2)] uses a novel robust version of the ICP algorithm. In registering retinal image pairs, Dual-Bootstrap ICP is initialized by automatically matching individual vascular landmarks, and it aligns images based on detected blood vessel centerlines. The resulting quadratic transformations are accurate to less than a pixel. On tests involving approximately 6000 image pairs, it successfully registered 99.5% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark, and 100% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark and at least 35% image overlap.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.819276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242341","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Retina;Image registration;Iterative algorithms;Testing;Image analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Robustness;Blood vessels","Algorithms;Fluorescein Angiography;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Vessels;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","265","47","88","IEEE","3 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is the case, for example, if one wants to remove JPEG artifacts or for JPEG re-compression. In this paper, a fast and efficient method is provided to determine whether an image has been previously JPEG compressed. After detecting a compression signature, we estimate compression parameters. Specifically, we developed a method for the maximum likelihood estimation of JPEG quantization steps.

This is due to their simplicity, generality and success over a wide range of challenging applications. Particle filters, and Monte Carlo methods in general, are however poor at consistently maintaining the multimodality of the target distributions that may arise due to ambiguity or the presence of multiple objects. To address this shortcoming this paper proposes to model the target distribution as a nonparametric mixture model, and presents the general tracking recursion in this case. It is shown how a Monte Carlo implementation of the general recursion leads to a mixture of particle filters that interact only in the computation of the mixture weights, thus leading to an efficient numerical algorithm, where all the results pertaining to standard particle filters apply. The ability of the new method to maintain posterior multimodality is illustrated on a synthetic example and a real world tracking problem involving the tracking of football players in a video sequence.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238473","","Radar tracking;Particle filters;Filtering;Target tracking;Monte Carlo methods;Recursive estimation;Video sequences;Laser radar;Bayesian methods;Computer vision","","264","4","12","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike wired networks, random packet loss due to bit errors is not negligible in wireless networks, and this causes significant performance degradation of transmission control protocol (TCP). We propose and study a novel end-to-end congestion control mechanism called TCP Veno that is simple and effective for dealing with random packet loss. A key ingredient of Veno is that it monitors the network congestion level and uses that information to decide whether packet losses are likely to be due to congestion or random bit errors. Specifically: (1) it refines the multiplicative decrease algorithm of TCP Reno-the most widely deployed TCP version in practice-by adjusting the slow-start threshold according to the perceived network congestion level rather than a fixed drop factor and (2) it refines the linear increase algorithm so that the connection can stay longer in an operating region in which the network bandwidth is fully utilized. Based on extensive network testbed experiments and live Internet measurements, we show that Veno can achieve significant throughput improvements without adversely affecting other concurrent TCP connections, including other concurrent Reno connections. In typical wireless access networks with 1% random packet loss rate, throughput improvement of up to 80% can be demonstrated. A salient feature of Veno is that it modifies only the sender-side protocol of Reno without changing the receiver-side protocol stack.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.807336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177186","","Wireless networks;Access protocols;IP networks;Throughput;Wireless LAN;Home automation;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Propagation losses;Error correction;Performance loss","","263","7","41","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal is to resist both geometric distortion and signal processing attacks. We adopt a feature extraction method called Mexican hat wavelet scale interaction. The extracted feature points can survive a variety of attacks and be used as reference points for both watermark embedding and detection. The normalized image of an image (object) is nearly invariant with respect to rotations. As a result, the watermark detection task can be much simplified when it is applied to the normalized image. However, because image normalization is sensitive to image local variation, we apply image normalization to nonoverlapped image disks separately. The disks are centered at the extracted feature points. Several copies of a 16-bit watermark sequence are embedded in the original image to improve the robustness of watermarks. Simulation results show that our scheme can survive low-quality JPEG compression, color reduction, sharpening, Gaussian filtering, median filtering, row or column removal, shearing, rotation, local warping, cropping, and linear geometric transformations.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.809367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188741","","Robustness;Digital images;Watermarking;Feature extraction;Nonlinear filters;Filtering;Resists;Distortion;Signal processing;Solid modeling","","263","2","17","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents a novel algorithm that combines Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering and scan matching. In our approach scan matching is used for minimizing odometric errors during mapping. A probabilistic model of the residual errors of scan matching process is then used for the resampling steps. This way the number of samples required is seriously reduced.

Next, text regions are identified by applying a continuously adaptive mean shift algorithm (CAMSHIFT) to the results of the texture analysis. The combination of CAMSHIFT and SVMs produces both robust and efficient text detection, as time-consuming texture analyses for less relevant pixels are restricted, leaving only a small part of the input image to be texture-analyzed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1251157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251157","","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Image texture analysis;Image analysis;Robustness;Pixel;Carbon capture and storage;Indexing;Degradation;Neural networks","","261","3","34","IEEE","8 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such mechanisms usually need to maintain state, manage buffers, and/or perform packet scheduling on a per-flow basis, and this complexity may prevent them from being cost-effectively implemented and widely deployed. We propose an architecture that significantly reduces this implementation complexity yet still achieves approximately fair bandwidth allocations. We apply this approach to an island of routers - that is, a contiguous region of the network - and we distinguish between edge routers and core routers. Edge routers maintain per-flow state; they estimate the incoming rate of each flow and insert a label into each packet based on this estimate. Core routers maintain no per-flow state; they use first-in-first-out packet scheduling augmented by a probabilistic dropping algorithm that uses the packet labels and an estimate of the aggregate traffic at the router. We call the scheme core-stateless fair queueing. We present simulations and analysis on the performance of this approach.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2002.808414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180544","","Channel allocation;High-speed networks;Scheduling algorithm;State estimation;Mechanical factors;Internet;Aggregates;Traffic control;Analytical models;Performance analysis","","261","5","36","IEEE","25 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such priors are appropriate for obtaining sparse representations of environmental signals within an appropriately chosen (environmentally matched) dictionary. The elements of the dictionary can be interpreted as concepts, features, or words capable of succinct expression of events encountered in the environment (the source of the measured signals). This is a generalization of vector quantization in that one is interested in a description involving a few dictionary entries (the proverbial “25 words or less”), but not necessarily as succinct as one entry. To learn an environmentally adapted dictionary capable of concise expression of signals generated by the environment, we develop algorithms that iterate between a representative set of sparse representations found by variants of FOCUSS and an update of the dictionary using these sparse representations. Experiments were performed using synthetic data and natural images. For complete dictionaries, we demonstrate that our algorithms have improved performance over other independent component analysis (ICA) methods, measured in terms of signal-to-noise ratios of separated sources. In the overcomplete case, we show that the true underlying dictionary and sparse sources can be accurately recovered. In tests with natural images, learned overcomplete dictionaries are shown to have higher coding efficiency than complete dictionaries; that is, images encoded with an overcomplete dictionary have both higher compression (fewer bits per pixel) and higher accuracy (lower mean square error).","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976603762552951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790047","","","","261","4","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

It is therefore important to analyze the capacities of such systems in realistic situations, which may include spatially correlated channels and correlated noise, as well as correlated interferers with known channel at the receiver. Here, we present an approach that provides analytic expressions for the statistics, i.e., the moments of the distribution, of the mutual information of multiple-antenna systems with arbitrary correlations, interferers, and noise. We assume that the channels of the signal and the interference are Gaussian with arbitrary covariance. Although this method is valid formally for large antenna numbers, it produces extremely accurate results even for arrays with as few as two or three antennas. We also develop a method to analytically optimize over the input signal covariance, which enables us to calculate analytic capacities when the transmitter has knowledge of the statistics of the channel (i.e., the channel covariance). In many cases of interest, this capacity is very close to the full closed-loop capacity, in which the transmitter has instantaneous channel knowledge. We apply this analytic approach to a number of examples and we compare our results with simulations to establish the validity of this approach. This method provides a simple tool to analyze the statistics of throughput for arrays of any size. The emphasis of this paper is on elucidating the novel mathematical methods used.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237135","","MIMO;Channel capacity;Statistical analysis;Throughput;Signal analysis;Transmitters;Wireless communication;Information analysis;Statistical distributions;Mutual information","","259","24","28","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Toward this end, we propose a variational level set framework that can account for global shape consistency as well as for local deformations. In order to improve performance, the problems of segmentation and tracking of the structure of interest are dealt with simultaneously by introducing the notion of time in the process and looking for a solution that satisfies that prior constraints while being consistent along consecutive frames.

The model is based on the separation of the loss contributions due to hysteresis, eddy currents, and excess losses with the two supplies. Since any contribution depends on the voltage supply characteristics, it is possible to find a direct mathematical relationship between the iron loss contribution and the voltage supply characteristics. As a consequence, an iron loss prediction can be obtained with any voltage supply if it does not produce a hysteresis minor loop. The energetic model is based on coefficients that depend on the magnetic material characteristic. We performed an accurate analysis of the model on eight magnetic materials used for electrical machine construction, of different thicknesses and alloy compositions.

The reasons are the limited accuracy of stator voltage acquisition and the presence of offset and drift components in the acquired signals. To overcome these problems, a pure integrator is employed for stator flux estimation. The time-variable DC offset voltage is estimated from the flux drift in a parallel stator model and used to eliminate the offset by feedforward control. Residual high-frequency disturbances are compensated by feedback flux amplitude control. A linearization of the pulsewidth-modulation inverter transfer function and an improved stator resistance estimation scheme further enhance the system performance.

In this paper, the specific case of information embedding into independent identically distributed (IID) data and attacks by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is considered. The original data is not available to the decoder. For Gaussian data, in 1983, Costa proposed a scheme that theoretically achieves the capacity of this communication scenario. However, Costa's scheme is not practical. Thus, several research groups have proposed suboptimal practical communication schemes based on Costa's idea. The goal of this paper is to give a complete performance analysis of the scalar Costa scheme (SCS), which is a suboptimal technique using scalar embedding and reception functions. Information theoretic bounds and simulation results with state-of-the-art coding techniques are compared. Further, reception after amplitude scaling attacks and the invertibility of SCS embedding are investigated.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.809366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188745","","Watermarking;AWGN;Decoding;Data security;Additive white noise;Information security;Noise robustness;Performance analysis;Information retrieval","","257","6","38","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, it is important to provide redundancy in terms of providing multiple node-disjoint paths from a source to a destination. We first propose a modified version of the popular AODV protocol that allows us to discover multiple node-disjoint paths from a source to a destination. We find that very few of such paths can be found. Furthermore, as distances between sources and destinations increase, bottlenecks inevitably occur and thus, the possibility of finding multiple paths is considerably reduced. We conclude that it is necessary to place what we call reliable nodes (in terms of both being robust to failure and being secure) in the network for efficient operations. We propose a deployment strategy that determines the positions and the trajectories of these reliable nodes such that we can achieve a framework for reliably routing information. We define a notion of a reliable path which is made up of multiple segments, each of which either entirely consists of reliable nodes, or contains a preset number of multiple paths between the end points of the segment. We show that the probability of establishing a reliable path between a random source and destination pair increases considerably even with a low percentage of reliable nodes when we control their positions and trajectories in accordance with our algorithm.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208679","","Routing;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Ad hoc networks;Robustness;Batteries;Fading;Redundancy;Protocols;Telecommunication network reliability","","256","2","20","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, we propose a new generic graph model for traffic grooming in heterogeneous WDM mesh networks. The novelty of our model is that, by only manipulating the edges of the auxiliary graph created by our model and the weights of these edges, our model can achieve various objectives using different grooming policies, while taking into account various constraints such as transceivers, wavelengths, wavelength-conversion capabilities, and grooming capabilities. Based on the auxiliary graph, we develop an integrated traffic-grooming algorithm (IGABAG) and an integrated grooming procedure (INGPROC) which jointly solve several traffic-grooming subproblems by simply applying the shortest-path computation method. Different grooming policies can be represented by different weight-assignment functions, and the performance of these grooming policies are compared under both nonblocking scenario and blocking scenario. The IGABAG can be applied to both static and dynamic traffic grooming. In static grooming, the traffic-selection scheme is key to achieving good network performance. We propose several traffic-selection schemes based on this model and we evaluate their performance for different network topologies.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.810310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194824","","Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Intelligent networks;Wavelength division multiplexing;WDM networks;Mesh networks;Bandwidth;Network topology;Laboratories;Transceivers","","255","4","36","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we formulate a general framework for tracking an acoustic source using particle filters. We discuss four specific algorithms that fit within this framework, and demonstrate their performance using both simulated reverberant data and data recorded in a moderately reverberant office room (with a measured reverberation time of 0.39 s).

We use this duality result to evaluate the system capacity achievable in a cellular wireless network with multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas at each terminal. Some fundamental properties of the rate region are exhibited and algorithms for determining the optimal weighted rate sum and the optimal covariance matrices for achieving a given rate vector on the boundary of the rate region are presented. These algorithms are then used in a simulation study to determine potential capacity enhancements to a cellular system through known-interference cancellation. We study both the circuit data scenario in which each user requires a constant data rate in every frame and the packet data scenario in which users can be assigned a variable rate in each frame so as to maximize the long-term average throughput. In the case of circuit data, the outage probability as a function of the number of active users served at a given rate is determined through simulations. For the packet data case, long-term average throughputs that can be achieved using the proportionally fair scheduling algorithm are determined. We generalize the zero-forcing beamforming technique to the multiple receive antennas case and use this as the baseline for the packet data throughput evaluation.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.810346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203165","","Downlink;Land mobile radio cellular systems;MIMO;Throughput;Circuit simulation;Broadcasting;Cellular networks;Wireless networks;Base stations;Covariance matrix","","254","5","26","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our analysis and simulations show that, given a specific network topology and flow patterns, there exists a TCP window size W*, at which TCP achieves best throughput via improved spatial channel reuse. However, TCP does not operate around W*, and typically grows its average window size much larger; this leads to decreased throughput and increased packet loss. The TCP throughput reduction can be explained by its loss behavior. Our results show that network overload is mainly signified by wireless link contention in multihop wireless networks. As long as the buffer size at each node is reasonably large (say, larger than 10 packets), buffer overflow-induced packet loss is rare and packet drops due to link-layer contention dominate. Link-layer drops offer the first sign for network overload. We further show that multihop wireless links collectively exhibit graceful drop behavior: as the offered load increases, the link contention drop probability also increases, but saturates eventually. In general, the link drop probability is insufficient to stabilize the average TCP window size around W*. Consequently, TCP suffers from reduced throughput due to reduced spatial reuse. We further propose two techniques, link RED and adaptive pacing, through which we are able to improve TCP throughput by 5% to 30% in various simulated topologies. Some simulation results are also validated by real hardware experiments.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209197","","Throughput;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks;Buffer overflow;Analytical models;Network topology;Computer science;Performance loss;Wireless application protocol;Access protocols","","254","4","13","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the method works without torque profile functions and auxiliary phase commutating strategies. Therefore, the control algorithm offers a wide drive operating range without the use of a high-resolution shaft position sensor or sensitive position estimation techniques.

However, OFDM's performance suffers from the loss of multipath diversity, and the inability to guarantee symbol detectability when channel nulls occur. We introduce a linear constellation precoded OFDM for wireless transmissions over frequency-selective fading channels. Exploiting the correlation structure of subchannels and choosing system parameters properly, we first perform an optimal subcarrier grouping to divide the set of subchannels into subsets. Within each subset, a linear constellation-specific precoder is then designed to maximize both diversity and coding gains. While greatly reducing the decoding complexity and simplifying the precoder design, subcarrier grouping enables the maximum possible diversity and coding gains. In addition to reduced complexity, the proposed system guarantees symbol detectability regardless of channel nulls, and does not reduce the transmission rate. Analytic evaluation and corroborating simulations reveal its performance merits.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.809791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194447","","Frequency-selective fading channels;Decoding;Frequency division multiplexing;OFDM modulation;Peak to average power ratio;Code standards;Performance loss;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Propagation losses","","252","27","21","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we address the problem of modeling dynamic scenes where the assumption of a static background is not valid. Waving trees, beaches, escalators, natural scenes with rain or snow are examples. Inspired by the work proposed by Doretto et al.

To verify properties of the state trajectories for PIHA, the planar switching surfaces are partitioned to define a finite set of discrete states in an approximate quotient transition system (AQTS). State transitions in the AQTS are determined by the reachable states, or flow pipes, emitting from the switching surfaces according to the continuous dynamics. This paper presents a method for computing polyhedral approximations to flow pipes. It is shown that the flow-pipe approximation error can be made arbitrarily small for general nonlinear dynamics and that the computations can be made more efficient for affine systems.

The fuzzy pixel-based classifier utilizes both spectral and spatial information to discriminate between spectrally similar road and building urban land cover classes. After the pixel-based classification, a technique that utilizes both spectral and spatial heterogeneity is used to segment the image to facilitate further object-based classification. An object-based fuzzy logic classifier is then implemented to improve upon the pixel-based classification by identifying one additional class in dense urban areas: nonroad, nonbuilding impervious surface. With the fuzzy pixel-based classification as input, the object-based classifier then uses shape, spectral, and neighborhood features to determine the final classification of the segmented image. Using these techniques, the object-based classifier is able to identify buildings, impervious surface, and roads in dense urban areas with 76%, 81%, and 99% classification accuracies, respectively.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.815972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237403","","Urban areas;Pixel;Image segmentation;Multispectral imaging;Roads;NASA;Fuzzy logic;Shape;Remote sensing;Image processing","","251","5","25","IEEE","20 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An implementation scheme for normal convolution and for recursive filtering is proposed. Also directed derivative filters are demonstrated. For the recursive implementation, filtering an 512 /spl times/ 512 image is performed within 40 msec on a current state of the art PC, gaining over 3 times in performance for a typical filter, independent of the standard deviations and orientation of the filter. Accuracy of the filters is still reasonable when compared to truncation error or recursive approximation error. The anisotropic Gaussian filtering method allows fast calculation of edge and ridge maps, with high spatial and angular accuracy. For tracking applications, the normal anisotropic convolution scheme is more advantageous, with applications in the detection of dashed lines in engineering drawings.

The use of fixed size packets is proposed in light of the limited resources and management costs in sensor networks. The optimal fixed packet size is then determined for a set of radio and channel parameters by maximizing the energy efficiency metric. Further, the effect of error control on packet size optimization and energy efficiency is examined. While retransmission schemes are found to be energy inefficient, it is shown that forward error correction can improve the energy efficiency eventhough it introduces additional parity bits and encoding/decoding energy consumptions. In this regard, binary BCH codes are found to be 15% more energy efficient than the best performing convolutional codes, which have thus far been considered for error control in sensor networks.","","0-7803-7879-2","10.1109/SNPA.2003.1203351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203351","","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Error correction;Data communication;Resource management;Costs;Forward error correction;Decoding;Energy consumption;Convolutional codes","","249","3","27","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, observations of objects are often widely separated in time and space when viewed from multiple non-overlapping cameras. To address this problem, we present a novel approach for establishing object correspondence across non-overlapping cameras. Our multicamera tracking algorithm exploits the redundance in paths that people and cars tend to follow, e.g. roads, walk-ways or corridors, by using motion trends and appearance of objects, to establish correspondence. Our system does not require any inter-camera calibration, instead the system learns the camera topology and path probabilities of objects using Parzen windows, during a training phase. Once the training is complete, correspondences are assigned using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework. The learned parameters are updated with changing trajectory patterns. Experiments with real world videos are reported, which validate the proposed approach.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238451","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238451","","Cameras;Computer vision;Calibration;Surveillance;Tracking;Roads;Topology;Videos;Kernel;Training data","","248","20","15","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compare our model with the Epidemiological model and Weaver's simulator. Our results show that our model can characterize the spread of worms effectively. Taking the Code Red v2 worm as an example, we give a quantitative analysis for monitoring, detecting and defending against worms.

By modifying the scaling functions of BSREM, we are able to prove the convergence of the modified BSREM under realistic assumptions. Our modification also makes stepsize selection more convenient. In addition, we introduce relaxation into the OS-SPS algorithm (Erdogan and Fessler, 1999) that otherwise would converge to a limit cycle. We prove the global convergence of diagonally scaled incremental gradient methods of which the relaxed OS-SPS is a special case; main results of the proofs are from (Nedic and Bertsekas, 2001) and (Correa and Lemarechal, 1993).

Models explicitly represent the embedded software and the environment it operates in, and capture the requirements and the design of the application, simultaneously. Models are descriptive , in the sense that they allow the formal analysis, verification, and validation of the embedded system at design time. Models are also generative, in the sense that they carry enough information for automatically generating embedded systems using the techniques of program generators. Because of the widely varying nature of embedded systems, a single modeling language may not be suitable for all domains; thus, modeling languages are often domain-specific. To decrease the cost of defining and integrating domain-specific modeling languages and corresponding analysis and synthesis tools, the model-integrated approach is applied in a metamodeling architecture, where formal models of domain-specific modeling languages-called metamodels-play a key role in customizing and connecting components of tool chains. This paper discusses the principles and techniques of model-integrated embedded software development in detail, as well as the capabilities of the tools supporting the process. Examples in terms of real systems will be given that illustrate how the model-integrated approach addresses the physical nature, the assurance issues, and the dynamic structure of embedded software.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.805824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173205","","Embedded software;Embedded system;Embedded computing;Microwave integrated circuits;Design engineering;Timing;Automatic programming;Costs;Metamodeling","","247","21","41","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its introduction in the clinical routine limited the occurrence of fetal problems leading to a reduction of the precocious child mortality. Nevertheless, very poor indications on fetal pathologies can be inferred from the even automatic CTG analysis methods, which are actually employed. The feeling is that fetal heart rate (FHR) signals and uterine contractions carry much more information on fetal state than is usually extracted by classical analysis methods. In particular, FHR signal contains indications about the neural development of the fetus. However, the methods actually adopted for judging a CTG trace as ""abnormal"" give weak predictive indications about fetal dangers. We propose a new methodological approach for the CTG monitoring, based on a multiparametric FHR analysis, which includes spectral parameters from autoregressive models and nonlinear algorithms (approximate entropy). This preliminary study considers 14 normal fetuses, eight cases of gestational (maternal) diabetes, and 13 intrauterine growth retarded fetuses. A comparison with the traditional time domain analysis is also included. This paper shows that the proposed new parameters are able to separate normal from pathological fetuses. Results constitute the first step for realizing a new clinical classification system for the early diagnosis of most common fetal pathologies.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.808824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186740","","Signal analysis;Fetal heart rate;Cardiography;Pathology;Data mining;Information analysis;Fetus;Condition monitoring;Spectral analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","Algorithms;Cardiotocography;Diabetes, Gestational;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Fetal Growth Retardation;Fetal Growth Retardation;Fetal Monitoring;Fetal Movement;Heart Rate;Heart Rate, Fetal;Humans;Linear Models;Models, Cardiovascular;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pregnancy;Quality Control;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Retrospective Studies;Sensitivity and Specificity","247","3","42","IEEE","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the cost of a direct extension of the FGT to higher-dimensional problems grows exponentially with dimension, making it impractical for dimensions above 3. We develop an improved fast Gauss transform to efficiently estimate sums of Gaussians in higher dimensions, where a new multivariate expansion scheme and an adaptive space subdivision technique dramatically improve the performance.

The local spatial continuity constraint reduces the noise effect and the classification ambiguity. The INU artifact is formulated as a multiplicative bias field affecting the true MR imaging signal. By modeling the log bias field as a stack of smoothing B-spline surfaces, with continuity enforced across slices, the computation of the 3-D bias field reduces to that of finding the B-spline coefficients, which can be obtained using a computationally efficient two-stage algorithm.

Various types of power system dynamics simulations exist and the approach depends on the aspect of power system dynamic behavior being investigated. In this paper, the focus is on fundamental frequency simulations, also known as electromechanical transient simulations. In this type of simulation, the network is represented as an impedance matrix and only the fundamental frequency component of voltages and currents is taken into account in order to reduce the computation time.

Motivated by the automatic identification of normal organs for applications in radiation therapy treatment planning, we present a method to construct a probabilistic atlas of an abdomen consisting of four organs (i.e., liver, kidneys, and spinal cord). Using 32 noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, 31 were mapped onto one individual scan using thin plate spline as the warping transform and mutual information (MI) as the similarity measure. Except for an initial coarse placement of four control points by the operators, the MI-based registration was automatic. Additionally, the four organs in each of the 32 CT data sets were manually segmented. The manual segmentations were warped onto the ""standard"" patient space using the same transform computed from their gray scale CT data set and a probabilistic atlas was calculated. Then, the atlas was used to aid the segmentation of low-contrast organs in an additional 20 CT data sets not included in the atlas. By incorporating the atlas information into the Bayesian framework, segmentation results clearly showed improvements over a standard unsupervised segmentation method.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.809139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200918","","Abdomen;Computed tomography;Buildings;Biomedical applications of radiation;Liver;Spinal cord;Spline;Mutual information;Automatic control;Bayesian methods","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Databases, Factual;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Liver;Models, Anatomic;Models, Statistical;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiography, Abdominal;Radiography, Abdominal;Spinal Cord;Spleen;Subtraction Technique","246","16","57","IEEE","28 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knowledge of this response is necessary for computer vision algorithms which depend on scene radiance. One way the response has been determined is by establishing a mapping of intensity values between images taken with different exposures. We call this mapping the intensity mapping function. In this paper, we address two basic questions. What information from a pair of images taken at different exposures is needed to determine the intensity mapping function? Given this function, can the response of the camera and the exposures of the images be determined? We completely determine the ambiguities associated with the recovery of the response and the ratios of the exposures. We show all methods that have been used to recover the response break these ambiguities by making assumptions on the exposures or on the form of the response. We also show when the ratio of exposures can be recovered directly from the intensity mapping, without recovering the response. We show that the intensity mapping between images is determined solely by the intensity histograms of the images. We describe how this allows determination of the intensity mapping between images without registration. This makes it possible to determine the intensity mapping in sequences with some motion of both the camera and objects in the scene.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1240119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240119","","Cameras;Layout;Lighting;Histograms;Dynamic range;Statistics;Computer vision;Radiometry;Machine vision","","246","12","27","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We address the scheduling problem for such time-constrained dual-armed cluster tools that have diverse wafer flow patterns. We propose a systematic method of determining the schedulable process time range for which there exists a feasible schedule that satisfies the time constraints. We explain how to select the desirable process times within the schedulable process time range. We present a method of determining the tool operation schedule.

Robustness against geometric distortion and JPEG compression at the same time with blind extraction remains especially challenging. A blind discrete wavelet transform-discrete Fourier transform (DWT-DFT) composite image watermarking algorithm that is robust against both affine transformation and JPEG compression is proposed. The algorithm improves robustness by using a new embedding strategy, watermark structure, 2D interleaving, and synchronization technique. A spread-spectrum-based informative watermark with a training sequence is embedded in the coefficients of the LL subband in the DWT domain while a template is embedded in the middle frequency components in the DFT domain. In watermark extraction, we first detect the template in a possibly corrupted watermarked image to obtain the parameters of an affine transform and convert the image back to its original shape. Then, we perform translation registration using the training sequence embedded in the DWT domain, and, finally, extract the informative watermark. Experimental work demonstrates that the proposed algorithm generates a more robust watermark than other reported watermarking algorithms. Specifically it is robust simultaneously against almost all affine transform related testing functions in StirMark 3.1 and JPEG compression with quality factor as low as 10. While the approach is presented for gray-level images, it can also be applied to color images and video sequences.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2003.815957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227607","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Watermarking;Robustness;Transform coding;Image coding;Discrete transforms;Fourier transforms;Interleaved codes;Frequency synchronization;Discrete Fourier transforms","","246","25","26","IEEE","4 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system classifies rotation in all viewing directions, detects eye/mouth occlusion, detects eye blinking and eye closure, and recovers the three dimensional gaze of the eyes. In addition, the system is able to track both through occlusion due to eye blinking, and eye closure, large mouth movement, and also through occlusion due to rotation. Even when the face is fully occluded due to rotation, the system does not break down. Further the system is able to track through yawning, which is a large local mouth motion.

The stability of these interfaces has allowed continual advances in both storage devices and applications, without frequent changes to the standards. However, the interface ultimately determines the functionality supported by the devices, and current interfaces are holding system designers back. Storage technology has progressed to the point that a change in the device interface is needed. Object-based storage is an emerging standard designed to address this problem. In this article we describe object-based storage, stressing how it improves data sharing, security, and device intelligence. We also discuss some industry applications of object-based storage and academic research using objects as a foundation for building even more intelligent storage systems.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2003.1222722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1222722","","Secure storage;Data security;Disk drives;Stability;Multimedia databases;Operating systems;Costs;File servers;File systems;Storage area networks","","246","156","15","IEEE","18 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We use a direct image-to-image similarity measure, taking advantage of the speed of modern computer graphics workstations to quickly render simulated (predicted) images. As a result, the method does not require an accurate segmentation of the implant silhouette in the image (which can be prone to errors). A robust optimization algorithm (simulated annealing) is used that can escape local minima and find the global minimum (true solution). Although we focus on the analysis of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in this paper, the method can be (and has been) applied to other implanted joints, including, but not limited to, hips, ankles, and temporomandibular joints. Convergence tests on an in vivo image show that the registration method can reliably find poses that are very close to the optimal (i.e., within 0.4/spl deg/ and 0.1 mm), even from starting poses with large initial errors. However, the precision of translation measurement in the Z (out-of-plane) direction is not as good. We also show that the method is robust with respect to image noise and occlusions. However, a small amount of user supervision and intervention is necessary to detect cases when the optimization algorithm falls into a local minimum. Intervention is required less than 5% of the time when the initial starting pose is reasonably close to the correct answer, but up to 50% of the time when the initial starting pose is far away. Finally, extensive evaluations were performed on cadaver images to determine accuracy of relative pose measurement. Comparing against data derived from an optical sensor as a ""gold standard,"" the overall root-mean-square error of the registration method was approximately 1.5/spl deg/ and 0.65 mm (although Z translation error was higher). However, uncertainty in the optical sensor data may account for a large part of the observed error.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.820027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247785","","Robustness;Knee;Implants;Computational modeling;Optical sensors;X-ray imaging;Velocity measurement;Computer graphics;Workstations;Rendering (computer graphics)","Algorithms;Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee;Cadaver;Computer Simulation;Equipment Failure Analysis;Fluoroscopy;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Knee Joint;Knee Joint;Knee Joint;Models, Biological;Prosthesis Design;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","245","13","72","IEEE","24 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This statistical edge detection is data driven, unlike standard methods for edge detection which are model based. For any set of edge detection filters (implementing local edge cues), we use presegmented images to learn the probability distributions of filter responses conditioned on whether they are evaluated on or off an edge. Edge detection is formulated as a discrimination task specified by a likelihood ratio test on the filter responses. This approach emphasizes the necessity of modeling the image background (the off-edges). We represent the conditional probability distributions nonparametrically and illustrate them on two different data sets of 100 (Sowerby) and 50 (South Florida) images. Multiple edges cues, including chrominance and multiple-scale, are combined by using their joint distributions. Hence, this cue combination is optimal in the statistical sense. We evaluate the effectiveness of different visual cues using the Chernoff information and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves. This shows that our approach gives quantitatively better results than the Canny edge detector when the image background contains significant clutter. In addition, it enables us to determine the effectiveness of different edge cues and gives quantitative measures for the advantages of multilevel processing, for the use of chrominance, and for the relative effectiveness of different detectors. Furthermore, we show that we can learn these conditional distributions on one data set and adapt them to the other with only slight degradation of performance without knowing the ground truth on the second data set. This shows that our results are not purely domain specific. We apply the same approach to the spatial grouping of edge cues and obtain analogies to nonmaximal suppression and hysteresis.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1159946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159946","","Image edge detection;Detectors;Object detection;Gabor filters;Probability distribution;Testing;Statistical distributions;Degradation;Hysteresis;Statistical learning","","245","4","40","IEEE","14 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We incorporate round-trip delay in this model, and show that one can generalize observations regarding TCP-type congestion avoidance to more general window flow control schemes. We then consider explicit congestion notification (ECN) as an alternate mechanism (instead of losses) for signaling congestion and show that ECN marking levels can be designed to nearly eliminate losses in the network by choosing the marking level independently for each node in the network. While the ECN marking level at each node may depend on the number of flows through the node, the appropriate marking level can be estimated using only aggregate flow measurements, i.e., per-flow measurements are not required.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.818183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237444","","Loss measurement;Fluid flow measurement;Pricing;Delay;Signal design;Aggregates;Internet;Surges;Admission control;Systems engineering and theory","","245","4","44","IEEE","20 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed new algorithm moves particles towards nearby particles of higher fitness, instead of attracting each particle towards just the best position discovered so far by any particle. This is accomplished by using the ratio of the relative fitness and the distance of other particles to determine the direction in which each component of the particle position needs to be changed. The resulting algorithm (FDR-PSO) is shown to perform significantly better than the original PSO algorithm and some of its variants, on many different benchmark optimization problems. Empirical examination of the evolution of the particles demonstrates that the convergence of the algorithm does not occur at an early phase of particle evolution, unlike PSO. Avoiding premature convergence allows FDR-PSO to continue search for global optima in difficult multimodal optimization problems.","","0-7803-7914-4","10.1109/SIS.2003.1202264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202264","","Convergence;Cognition;Particle swarm optimization;Performance analysis;Application software;Problem-solving;Power engineering and energy;Computer science;Animals;Evolutionary computation","","242","","21","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristic of the SDS is that it can tolerate content-preserving modifications while detecting content-changing modifications. Many incidental manipulations, which were detected as malicious modifications in the previous digital signature verification or fragile watermarking schemes, can be bypassed in the proposed scheme. Performance analysis is conducted and experimental results show that the new scheme is indeed superb for image authentication.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2003.811621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208487","","Digital signatures;Authentication;Watermarking;Resists;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms;Robustness;Protection;Quantization;Performance analysis","","242","31","11","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a given space-frequency code, we quantify the achievable diversity order and coding gain as a function of the propagation parameters. We find that while the presence of spatial receive correlation affects all space-frequency codes equally, spatial fading correlation at the transmit array can result in widely varying performance losses. High-rate space-frequency codes such as spatial multiplexing are typically significantly more affected by transmit correlation than low-rate codes such as space-frequency block codes.

The objective of this study was to develop a computer-aided system that will facilitate the characterization of carotid plaques for the identification of individuals with asymptomatic carotid stenosis at risk of stroke. A total of 230 plaque images were collected which were classified into two types: symptomatic because of ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms, or asymptomatic because they were not connected with ipsilateral hemispheric events. Ten different texture feature sets were extracted from the manually segmented plaque images using the following algorithms: first-order statistics, spatial gray level dependence matrices, gray level difference statistics, neighborhood gray tone difference matrix, statistical feature matrix, Laws texture energy measures, fractal dimension texture analysis, Fourier power spectrum and shape parameters. For the classification task a modular neural network composed of self-organizing map (SOM) classifiers, and combining techniques based on a confidence measure were used. Combining the classification results of the ten SOM classifiers inputted with the ten feature sets improved the classification rate of the individual classifiers, reaching an average diagnostic yield (DY) of 73.1%. The same modular system was implemented using the statistical k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The combined DY for the KNN system was 68.8%. The results of this paper show that it is possible to identify a group of patients at risk of stroke based on texture features extracted from ultrasound images of carotid plaques. This group of patients may benefit from a carotid endarterectomy whereas other patients may be spared from an unnecessary operation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2003.815066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1216213","","Ultrasonic imaging;Feature extraction;Statistical analysis;Shape measurement;Morphology;High-resolution imaging;Image segmentation;Energy measurement;Power measurement;Fractals","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Coronary Artery Disease;Coronary Artery Disease;Coronary Artery Disease;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Nerve Net;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography","242","1","26","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One reason for this expense is the Federal Aviation Administration's requirement that test suites be modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) adequate. Despite its cost, there is evidence that MC/DC is an effective verification technique and can help to uncover safety faults. As the software is modified and new test cases are added to the test suite, the test suite grows and the cost of regression testing increases. To address the test-suite size problem, researchers have investigated the use of test-suite reduction algorithms, which identify a reduced test suite that provides the same coverage of the software according to some criterion as the original test suite, and test-suite prioritization algorithms, which identify an ordering of the test cases in the test suite according to some criteria or goals. Existing test-suite reduction and prioritization techniques, however, may not be effective in reducing or prioritizing MC/DC-adequate test suites because they do not consider the complexity of the criterion. This paper presents new algorithms for test-suite reduction and prioritization that can be tailored effectively for use with MC/DC.

Since the robot forms a single rigid body with the anatomy, there is no need for immobilization or motion tracking, which greatly enhances and simplifies the robot's registration to the target anatomy. To demonstrate this concept, we developed the MiniAture Robot for Surgical procedures (MARS), a cylindrical 5/spl times/7 cm/sup 3/, 200-g, six-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator. We are currently developing two clinical applications to demonstrate the concept: 1) surgical tools guiding for spinal pedicle screws placement; and 2) drill guiding for distal locking screws in intramedullary nailing. In both cases, a tool guide attached to the robot is positioned at a planned location with a few intraoperative fluoroscopic X-ray images.

To render a full-color image, an interpolation process, commonly referred to as CFA demosaicking, is required to estimate the other two missing color values at each pixel. In this paper, we present two contributions to the CFA demosaicking: a new and improved CFA demosaicking method for producing high quality color images and new image measures for quantifying the performance of demosaicking methods. The proposed demosaicking method consists of two successive steps: an interpolation step that estimates missing color values by exploiting spatial and spectral correlations among neighboring pixels, and a post-processing step that suppresses noticeable demosaicking artifacts by adaptive median filtering. Moreover, in recognition of the limitations of current image measures, we propose two types of image measures to quantify the performance of different demosaicking methods; the first type evaluates the fidelity of demosaicked images by computing the peak signal-to-noise ratio and CIELAB /spl utri/E/sup *//sub ab/ for edge and smooth regions separately, and the second type accounts for one major demosaicking artifact-zipper effect. We gauge the proposed demosaicking method and image measures using several existing methods as benchmarks, and demonstrate their efficacy using a variety of test images.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.816004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233562","","Sensor arrays;Image sensors;Pixel;Interpolation;Color;Current measurement;Digital cameras;Digital filters;Rendering (computer graphics);Adaptive filters","","240","12","28","IEEE","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For real-world images, the contrasts of K/sub R/ and K/sub B/ are quite flat over a small region and this property is suitable for interpolation. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a low-complexity interpolation method to improve the image quality. We show that the frequency response of the proposed method is better than the conventional methods. Simulation results also verify that the proposed method obtain superior image quality on typical images. The luminance channel of the proposed method outperforms by 6.34-dB peak SNR the bilinear method, and the chrominance channels have a 7.69-dB peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement on average. Furthermore, the complexity of the proposed method is comparable to conventional bilinear interpolation.

Here, we provide proofs of security of standard quantum key distribution schemes, Bennett and Brassard and the six-state scheme, against the most general attack, by using the techniques of two-way entanglement purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only one-way classical communications in quantum key distribution (QKD). This is done by the explicit construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy amplification of) Bennett and Brassard that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which is higher than what any Bennett and Brassard scheme with only one-way classical communications can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state scheme over Bennett and Brassard by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a higher bit error rate than Bennett and Brassard. In particular, our six-state protocol can tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25% bit error rate for any secure Bennett and Brassard protocol. Consequently, our protocols may allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error correction, and privacy amplification protocols.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2002.807289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176619","","Quantum computing;Cryptographic protocols;Bit error rate;Cryptography;Purification;Privacy;Distributed computing;Security;Quantum entanglement;Error correction","","239","3","35","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A few such examples are the physically degraded and reversely degraded relay channels, the Gaussian multiple-access channel, and the Gaussian broadcast channel. The proposed scheme also leads to inner bounds for the multicast and allcast capacities. Applying the proposed scheme to a specific wireless network of n nodes located in a region of unit area, we show that a transport capacity of /spl Theta/(n) bit-meters per second (bit-meters/s) is feasible in a certain family of networks, as compared to the best possible transport capacity of /spl Theta/(/spl radic/n) bit-meters/s in Gupta et al.

In addition, a fast and physics-based inductor model is exploited to put the results contributed by many different groups in various technologies and achieved over the past eight years into perspective. Inductors are compared not only by their maximum quality factors (Q/sub max/), but also by taking the frequency at Q/sub max/, the inductance value (L), the self-resonance frequency (f/sub SR/), and the coil area into account. It is further explained that the spiral coil structure on a lossy silicon substrate can operate in three different modes, depending at first order on the silicon doping concentration. Ranging from high to low substrate resistivity, inductor-mode, resonator-mode, and eddy-current regimes are defined by characteristic changes of Q/sub max/, L, and f/sub SR/. The advantages and disadvantages of patterned or blanket resistive ground shields between the inductor coil and substrate and the effect of a substrate contact on the inductor are also addressed in this paper. Exploring optimum inductor designs under various constraints leverages the speed of the model. Finally, in view of the continuously increasing operating frequencies in advancing to new generations of RF systems, the range of feasible inductance values for given quality factors are predicted on the basis of optimum technological features.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2003.810474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202600","","Silicon;Q factor;Eddy currents;Losses;Electromagnetic shielding;Integrated circuit design;Integrated circuit modeling;Magnetic microwave devices","","239","35","65","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We study enhancement techniques for color images theoretically in a generalized setup. A principle is suggested to make the transformations gamut-problem free. Using the same principle, a class of hue-preserving, contrast-enhancing transformations is proposed; they generalize existing grey scale contrast intensification techniques to color images.

One such requirement is to achieve high-rate communications between clients, e.g., terminals or sensors, in the network while hiding information about the transmitted symbols, signal activity, or other sensitive data from an unintended receiver, e.g., an eavesdropper. For wireless links, the single-user capacity advantages of deployment of multiple antennas at the transmitter is well known. One of the principal conclusions of this paper is that proper exploitation of space-time diversity at the transmitter can also enhance information security and information-hiding capabilities. In particular, we show that significant gains are achievable when the transmitter and the client receiver are both informed about their channel while the transmitter and eavesdropper receiver are uniformed about their channel. More generally, we compare capacity limits for both informed and uninformed transmitter and informed receiver scenarios subject to low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) constraints. For several general cases, we can characterize the LPI- and LPD-optimal transmitted source distributions and compare them to the standard optimal source distribution satisfying a power constraint. We assume the standard quasi-static flat Rayleigh-fading channel model for the transmitter-receiver pairs.

The device presented in this paper is an 8×8 mm2 chip implemented in a two-poly three-metal 0.35-μm CMOS technology, featuring 102,400 actuation electrodes, arranged in an array of 320×320, 20 μm×20μm microsites each comprising addressing logic, an embedded memory for electrode programming, and an optical sensor. The chip enables software-controlled displacement of more than 10,000 individual living cells, allowing biologists to devise complex interaction protocols that are impossible to manage otherwise. The manipulation does not damage the viability of the cells, so that this approach could be a unique extension to the techniques already available to biologists.","1558-173X","","10.1109/JSSC.2003.819171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253877","","Optical sensors;CMOS technology;Electrodes;Optical arrays;Programmable logic arrays;Sensor arrays;Logic programming;Cells (biology);Silicon;Dielectrophoresis","","238","46","16","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem can arise when measurements are communicated over wireless channels. We model the plant/measurement loss process as a Markovian jump linear system. While the time-varying Kalman estimator (TVKE) is known to be optimal, we introduce a simpler design, termed a jump linear estimator (JLE), to cope with losses. A JLE has predictor/corrector form, but at each time selects a corrector gain from a finite set of precalculated gains. The motivation for the JLE is twofold. The computational burden of the JLE is less than that of the TVKE and the estimation errors expected when using JLE provide an upper bound for those expected when using TVKE. We then introduce a special class of JLE, termed finite loss history estimators (FLHE), which uses a canonical gain selection logic. A notion of optimality for the FLHE is defined and an optimal synthesis method is given. The proposed design method is compared to TVKE in a simulation study.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2003.820140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254085","","Loss measurement;State estimation;Linear systems;History;Associate members;Kalman filters;Fading;Wireless communication;Estimation error;Upper bound","","238","","20","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To illustrate this concept we may assume that at least two states of the epileptic brain are possible: the interictal state characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady-state electroencephalography (EEG) ongoing activity, and the ictal state, that is characterized by paroxysmal occurrence of synchronous oscillations and is generally called, in neurology, a seizure. The transition between these two states can either occur: 1) as a continuous sequence of phases, like in some cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE); or 2) as a sudden leap, like in most cases of absence seizures. In the mathematical terminology of nonlinear systems, we can say that in the first case the system's attractor gradually deforms from an interictal to an ictal attractor. The causes for such a deformation can be either endogenous or external. In this type of ictal transition, the seizure possibly may be anticipated in its early, preclinical phases. In the second case, where a sharp critical transition takes place, we can assume that the system has at least two simultaneous interictal and ictal attractors all the time. To which attractor the trajectories converge, depends on the initial conditions and the system's parameters. An essential question in this scenario is how the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity takes place. Such a transition can occur either due to the influence of external or endogenous factors or due to a random perturbation and, thus, it will be unpredictable. These dynamical changes may not be detectable from the analysis of the ongoing EEG, but they may be observable only by measuring the system's response to externally administered stimuli. In the special cases of reflex epilepsy, the leap between the normal ongoing attractor and the ictal attractor is caused by a well-defined external perturbation. Examples from these different scenarios are presented and discussed.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.810703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198244","","Diseases;Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Biological neural networks;Displays;Steady-state;Nervous system;Temporal lobe;Terminology;Nonlinear systems","Brain;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Neurons;Nonlinear Dynamics;Seizures;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","238","1","41","IEEE","13 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The convergence of the regularized FOCUSS algorithm is established and it is shown that the stable fixed points of the algorithm are sparse. We investigate three different criteria for choosing the regularization parameter: quality of fit; sparsity criterion; L-curve. The L-curve method, as applied to the problem of subset selection, is found not to be robust, and we propose a novel modified L-curve procedure that solves this problem. Each of the regularized FOCUSS algorithms is evaluated through simulation of a detection problem, and the results are compared with those obtained using a sequential forward selection algorithm termed orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP).

Instead, we may use pairwise or t-way testing to provide a guarantee that all pairs or t-way combinations of components are tested together This concept draws on methods used in statistical testing for manufacturing and has been extended to software system testing. A covering array, CA(N; t, k, v), is an N/spl times/k array on v symbols such that every N x t sub-array contains all ordered subsets from v symbols of size t at least once. The properties of these objects, however do not necessarily satisfy real software testing needs. Instead we examine a less studied object, the mixed level covering array and propose a new object, the variable strength covering array, which provides a more robust environment for software interaction testing. Initial results are presented suggesting that heuristic search techniques are more effective than some of the known greedy methods for finding smaller sized test suites. We present a discussion of an integrated approach for finding covering arrays and discuss how application of these techniques can be used to construct variable strength arrays.","0270-5257","0-7695-1877-X","10.1109/ICSE.2003.1201186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201186","","System testing;Software testing;Software systems;Local area networks;Linux;ISDN;Printers;Computer science;Statistical analysis;Manufacturing","","237","1","30","IEEE","28 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Almost all of these routing protocols considered energy efficiency as the ultimate objective in order to maximize the whole network lifetime. However, the introduction of video and imaging sensors has posed additional challenges. Transmission of video and imaging data requires both energy and QoS aware routing in order to ensure efficient usage of the sensors and effective access to the gathered measurements. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware QoS routing protocol, which can also run efficiently with best-effort traffic. The protocol finds a least-cost, delay-constrained path for real-time data in terms of link cost that captures nodes' energy reserve, transmission energy, error rate and other communication parameters. Moreover, throughput for non-real-time data is maximized by adjusting the service rate for both real-time and non-realtime data at sensor nodes.

The structure of the error events that reduce the minimum distance is examined, and constrained coding ideas are suggested that theoretically allow even faster signaling. Then we propose ways of achieving these gains practically by designing appropriate constrained codes and through equalization and iterative joint equalization and decoding (turbo equalization).","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.816943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231648","","Intersymbol interference;Bandwidth;Euclidean distance;Interference constraints;AWGN;Iterative decoding;Bit rate;Constraint theory;Interference cancellation;Communication systems","","236","10","23","IEEE","15 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FastSLAM, an alternative approach based on the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter, has been shown to scale logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This efficiency enables FastSLAM to be applied to environments far larger than could be handled by the EKF. In this paper, we show that FastSLAM also substantially outperforms the EKF in environments with ambiguous data association. The performance of the two algorithms is compared on a real-world data set with various levels of odometric noise.

In the past, super-resolution techniques have been proposed to increase the resolution by combining information from multiple images. These techniques use super-resolution as a preprocessing step to obtain a high-resolution image that is later passed to a face recognition system. Considering that most state-of-the-art face recognition systems use an initial dimensionality reduction method, we propose to transfer the super-resolution reconstruction from pixel domain to a lower dimensional face space. Such an approach has the advantage of a significant decrease in the computational complexity of the super-resolution reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm no longer tries to obtain a visually improved high-quality image, but instead constructs the information required by the recognition system directly in the low dimensional domain without any unnecessary overhead. In addition, we show that face-space super-resolution is more robust to registration errors and noise than pixel-domain super-resolution because of the addition of model-based constraints.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.811513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203152","","Face recognition;Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Surveillance;Computational complexity;Noise robustness;Cameras;Reconstruction algorithms;Image recognition","","233","2","16","IEEE","11 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, it permits us to transmit reliably to far destinations that the individual nodes are not able to reach without consuming rapidly their own battery resources, even when using multihop links (the reach-back problem). The synchronization constraints are extremely loose and can be fulfilled in a distributed manner. The key idea is to have the nodes simply echo the leader's transmission operating as active scatterers while using adaptive receivers that acquire the equivalent network signatures corresponding to the echoed symbols. The active nodes in the network operate either as regenerative or nonregenerative relays. The intuition is that each of the waveforms will be enhanced by the accumulation of power due to the aggregate transmission of all the nodes while, if kept properly under control, the random errors or the receiver noise that propagate together with the useful signals will cause limited deterioration in the performance. The avalanche of signals triggered by the network leaders form the so-called opportunistic large array (OLA). The main advantages of the OLA are its great flexibility and scalability.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.814519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212667","","Intelligent networks;Spread spectrum communication;Ad hoc networks;Relays;Repeaters;Scattering;Wireless networks;Batteries;Aggregates;Error correction","","232","6","24","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because channel state information (CSI) may be costly or impossible to acquire in rapidly varying wireless environments, we develop in this paper statistical water-filling approaches for stationary random fading channels. These approaches require only knowledge of the channel correlations that do not necessitate frequent updates, and can be easily acquired. Applied to a multiple transmit-antenna paradigm, our optimal transmitter design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the channel's correlation matrix, and with proper power loading across the beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing a tight bound on the symbol error rate. The resulting loaded eigen-beamforming outperforms not only the equal-power allocation across all antennas, but also the conventional beamformer that transmits the available power along the strongest direction. Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-dimensional (2-D) eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-dimensional (1-D) beamforming with uniformly better performance, without rate reduction, and without complexity increase.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.813565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1207368","","Transmitters;Block codes;Channel state information;Fading;Error analysis;Directive antennas;Loaded antennas;Transmitting antennas;Optical coupling;Two dimensional displays","","232","6","31","IEEE","25 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While it is certainly true that government public policies and regulations have played a major role in the rapidly growing rate at which distributed generation is penetrating the market, it is also the case that a number of technologies have reached a development stage allowing for large-scale implementation within existing electric utility systems. At the onset of any discussion related to distributed generation, one question begs to be answered: is the fact that electric power producing facilities are distributed actually a new and revolutionary concept? Have power plants not always been located across broad expanses of land? The answer to these questions clearly is that electric power plants have always been sited all across the service territories of the utilities owning them. Hence, the opening question: as with many so-called innovations that have been put forward during the recent past, is the entire concept of distributed generation a simple semantic marketing hype or are we actually at the dawn of a new electric power generation era? We believe that a new electric power production industry is emerging, and that it will rely on a broad array of new technologies. This article sets the stage for distributed generation covering such topics as: the present power production situation; what distributed generation is; capability ratings and system interfaces; market penetration of internal combustion engine generators, fuel cells and microturbines; potential generation mix issues, network considerations including power quality, reactive power coordination, reliability and reserve margin, reliability, network redundancy, safety and accountability; public policy and regulatory impact; and standards.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPAE.2003.1180357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180357","","Distributed control;Power generation;Power system reliability;Distributed power generation;Power industry;Public policy;Government;Large-scale systems;Technological innovation;Production","","232","","5","IEEE","19 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Both continuous doping charge and random discrete dopants in the active region of the MOSFETs are considered in the simulations. The dependence of the RTS amplitudes on the position of the trapped charge in the channel and on device design parameters such as dimensions, oxide thickness and channel doping concentration is studied in detail. The 3-D simulations offer a natural explanation for the large variation in the RTS amplitudes measured experimentally in otherwise identical MOSFETs. The random discrete dopant simulations result in RTS amplitudes several times higher compared to continuous charge simulations. They also produce closer to the experimentally observed distributions of the RTS amplitudes.

To make the different solutions available at the end of an algorithm run, procedures are needed for storing them, one by one, as they are found. In a simple case, this may be achieved by placing each point that is found into an ""archive"" which maintains only nondominated points and discards all others. However, even a set of mutually nondominated points is potentially very large, necessitating a bound on the archive's capacity. But with such a bound in place, it is no longer obvious which points should be maintained and which discarded; we would like the archive to maintain a representative and well-distributed subset of the points generated by the search algorithm, and also that this set converges. To achieve these objectives, we propose an adaptive archiving algorithm, suitable for use with any Pareto optimization algorithm, which has various useful properties as follows. It maintains an archive of bounded size, encourages an even distribution of points across the Pareto front, is computationally efficient, and we are able to prove a form of convergence. The method proposed here maintains evenness, efficiency, and cardinality, and provably converges under certain conditions but not all. Finally, the notions underlying our convergence proofs support a new way to rigorously define what is meant by ""good spread of points"" across a Pareto front, in the context of grid-based archiving schemes. This leads to proofs and conjectures applicable to archive sizing and grid sizing in any Pareto optimization algorithm maintaining a grid-based archive.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.810755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197686","","Pareto optimization;Convergence;Distributed computing;Evolutionary computation;Algorithm design and analysis;Stochastic processes;Computer science","","232","1","11","IEEE","7 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this scheme, a mobile's future location is predicted by the network, based on the information gathered from the mobile's recent report of location and velocity. When a call is made, the network pages the destination mobile around the predicted location. A mobile makes the same location prediction as the network does; it inspects its own location periodically and reports the new location when the distance between the predicted and the actual locations exceeds a threshold. To more realistically represent the various degrees of velocity correlation in time, a Gauss-Markov mobility model is used. For practical systems where the mobility pattern varies over time, we propose a dynamic Gauss-Markov parameter estimator that provides the mobility parameters to the prediction algorithm. Based on the Gauss-Markov model, we describe an analytical framework to evaluate the cost of mobility management for the proposed scheme. We also present an approximation method that reduces the computational complexity of the cost evaluation for multidimensional systems. We then compare the cost of predictive mobility management against that of the regular, nonpredictive distance-based scheme, for both the case with ideal Gauss-Markov mobility pattern and the case with time-varying mobility pattern.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2003.815301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237448","","Mobile radio mobility management;Multidimensional systems;Personal communication networks;Costs;Gaussian processes;Parameter estimation;Inspection;Communication standards;Telecommunication traffic;Prediction algorithms","","232","","33","IEEE","20 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior work has shown that even a single transient error occurring during the AES encryption (or decryption) process will very likely result in a large number of errors in the encrypted/decrypted data. Such faults must be detected before sending to avoid the transmission and use of erroneous data. Concurrent fault detection is important not only to protect the encryption/decryption process from random faults. It will also protect the encryption/decryption circuitry from an attacker who may maliciously inject faults in order to find the encryption secret key. In this paper, we first describe some studies of the effects that faults may have on a hardware implementation of AES by analyzing the propagation of such faults to the outputs. We then present two fault detection schemes: The first is a redundancy-based scheme while the second uses an error detecting code. The latter is a novel scheme which leads to very efficient and high coverage fault detection.

Packets destined for each ground location are stored in separate queues and the server rate for each queue, i, depends on the power, p/sub i/(t), allocated to that server and the channel state, c/sub i/(t), according to a concave rate-power curve /spl mu//sub i/(p/sub i/,c/sub i/). We establish the capacity region of all arrival rate vectors (/spl lambda//sub 1/,...,/spl lambda//sub N/) which admit a stabilizable system. We then develop a power-allocation policy which stabilizes the system whenever the rate vector lies within the capacity region. Such stability is guaranteed even if the channel model and the specific arrival rates are unknown. Furthermore, the algorithm is shown to be robust to arbitrary variations in the input rates and a bound on average delay is established. As a special case, this analysis verifies stability and provides a performance bound for the choose-the-K-largest-connected-queues policy when channels can be in one of two states (ON or OFF ) and K servers are allocated at every timestep (K<N). These results are extended to treat a joint problem of routing and power allocation in a system with multiple users and satellites; a throughput maximizing algorithm for this joint problem is constructed. Finally, we address the issue of interchannel interference and develop a modified policy when power vectors are constrained to feasible activation sets.

However, as a young, multidisciplinary research field, the BCI community lacks a common vocabulary. As a result, this deficiency leads to poor intergroup communication, which hinders the development of the desired methods of comparison. One of the principle reasons for the lack of common vocabulary is the absence of a common functional model of a BCI System. This paper proposes a new functional model for BCI System design. The model supports many features that facilitate the comparison of BCI technologies with other BCI and non-BCI user interface technologies. From this model, taxonomy for BCI System design is developed. Together the model and taxonomy are considered a general framework for BCI System design.

However, traditional gossip-based protocols have two major drawbacks: 1) they rely on each peer having knowledge of the global membership; and 2) being oblivious to the network topology, they can impose a high load on network links when applied to wide-area settings. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of gossip-based protocols which relates their reliability to key system parameters (the system size, failure rates, and number of gossip targets). The results provide guidelines for the design of practical protocols. In particular, they show how reliability can be maintained while alleviating drawback by: 1) providing each peer with only a small subset of the total membership information and drawback; and 2) organizing members into a hierarchical structure that reflects their proximity according to some network-related metric. We validate the analytical results by simulations and verify that the hierarchical gossip protocol considerably reduces the load on the network compared to the original, non-hierarchical protocol.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2003.1189583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189583","","Large-scale systems;Protocols;Telecommunication network reliability;Internet;Context;Network topology;Failure analysis;Reliability theory;Guidelines;Maintenance","","231","3","27","IEEE","26 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to maintain accuracy among individual NNs, the number of hidden nodes in individual NNs are also determined by a constructive approach. Incremental training based on negative correlation is used in CNNE to train individual NNs for different numbers of training epochs.

By shunting the piezoelectric transducer to an electrical impedance, a part of the induced electrical energy can be dissipated. Hence, the impedance acts as a means of extracting mechanical energy from the base structure. This paper reviews recent research related to the use of shunted piezoelectric elements for vibration damping and control. In particular, the paper presents an overview of the literature on piezoelectric shunt damping and discusses recent observations on the feedback nature of piezoelectric shunt damping systems.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2003.813371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208326","","Technological innovation;Vibration control;Damping;Piezoelectric transducers;Impedance;Flexible structures;Bonding;Capacitive sensors;Mechanical energy;Feedback","","230","15","75","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robust and accurate methods based on the singularity extraction technique are presented to evaluate the impedance matrix elements of the CFIE with these basis and test functions. In computing the impedance matrix elements, including the gradient of the Green's function, we can avoid the logarithmic singularity on the outer testing integral by modifying the integrand. In the developed method, all singularities are extracted and calculated in closed form and numerical integration is applied only for regular functions. In addition, we present compact iterative formulas for computing the extracted terms in closed form.

Many analog and digital approaches have been proposed for suppressing these interferences, and amongst these, rejection of the pulsive type of interferences is known to be very difficult, if not impossible. The time and frequency characteristics of the pulsive interference being very similar to that of the PD pulses is the main reason posing difficulty in their separation. In this paper, a novel, semi-automatic, and empirical wavelet-based method (using multi-resolution signal analysis) is proposed to recover PD pulses, buried in excessive noise/interference comprising of random, discrete spectral, pulsive, and any combination of these interferences occurring simultaneously and overlapping-in-time with the PD pulses. A critical assessment of the proposed method is carried out, by processing both simulated and practically acquired PD signals. The results obtained are also compared with those from the best digital filter (infinite impulse response, IIR and finite impulse response, FIR) method proposed in literature. From the results it emerges that, the wavelet approach is superior and further, has the unique capability of successfully rejecting all the three kinds of interferences, even when PD signals and one or all interferences occur simultaneously and overlap-in-time.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2003.1194122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194122","","Noise reduction;Partial discharges;Interference suppression;Partial discharge measurement;Stochastic resonance;Frequency;Wavelet analysis;Discrete wavelet transforms;Signal analysis;Signal processing","","229","","22","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper proposes a simple and efficient automatic gait recognition algorithm using statistical shape analysis. For each image sequence, an improved background subtraction procedure is used to extract moving silhouettes of a walking figure from the background. Temporal changes of the detected silhouettes are then represented as an associated sequence of complex vector configurations in a common coordinate frame, and are further analyzed using the Procrustes shape analysis method to obtain mean shape as gait signature. Supervised pattern classification techniques, based on the full Procrustes distance measure, are adopted for recognition. This method does not directly analyze the dynamics of gait, but implicitly uses the action of walking to capture the structural characteristics of gait, especially the shape cues of body biometrics. The algorithm is tested on a database consisting of 240 sequences from 20 different subjects walking at 3 viewing angles in an outdoor environment. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed algorithm.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2003.815251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221765","","Shape;Legged locomotion;Image sequence analysis;Computer vision;Surveillance;Computerized monitoring;Application software;Algorithm design and analysis;Image sequences;Pattern classification","","228","1","19","IEEE","18 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A decorrelation transformation is then applied to speech samples to approximate their multivariate distribution. To do this, speech is decomposed using an adaptive Karhunen-Loeve transform or a discrete cosine transform. Then, the distributions of speech components in decorrelated domains are investigated. Experimental evaluations prove that the statistics of speech signals are like a multivariate LD. All marginal distributions of speech are accurately described by LD in decorrelated domains.

We discuss the benefits and limits of several predefined polymetric views we have implemented in our tool CodeCrawler. Moreover, based on clusters of different polymetric views, we have developed a methodology which supports and guides a software engineer in the first phases of a reverse engineering of a large software system.

The technique is a generalization of the existing Zelinski post-filter, which uses the auto- and cross-spectral densities of the array inputs to estimate the signal and noise spectral densities. The Zelinski technique, however, assumes zero cross-correlation between the noise on different sensors. This assumption is inaccurate, particularly at low frequencies and for arrays with closely spaced sensors, and thus the corresponding post-filter is suboptimal in realistic noise conditions. In this paper, a more general expression of the post-filter estimation is developed based on an assumed knowledge of the complex coherence of the noise field. This general expression can be used to construct a more appropriate post-filter in a variety of different noise fields. In experiments using real noise recordings from a computer office, the modified post-filter results in significant improvement in terms of objective speech quality measures and speech recognition performance using a diffuse noise model.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.818212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255457","","Microphone arrays;Low-frequency noise;Speech enhancement;Coherence;Sensor arrays;Transfer functions;Frequency;Genetic expression;Speech recognition;Array signal processing","","227","13","16","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, there is a need for correction of this type of beat prior to any HRV analysis. This paper deals with the PSD estimation of the HRV by means of the heart timing (HT) signal when ectopic beats are present. These beat occurrence times are modeled from a generalized, continuous time integral pulse frequency modulation model and, from this point of view, a specific method for minimizing the effect of the presence of ectopic beats is presented to work together with the HT signal. By using both, a white noise driven autoregressive model of the HRV signal with artificially introduced ectopic beats and actual heart rate series including ectopic beats, the more usual methods of HRV spectral estimation are compared. Results of the PSD estimation error function of the number of ectopic beats are presented. These results demonstrate that the proposed method has one order of magnitude lower error than usual ectopic beats removal strategies in preserving PSD, thus, this strategy better recovers the original clinical indexes of interest.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.808831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186737","","Heart rate variability;Signal analysis;Timing;Time domain analysis;Pulse modulation;Frequency modulation;Pacemakers;Frequency estimation;White noise;Heart rate","Algorithms;Angioplasty, Transluminal, Percutaneous Coronary;Atrial Fibrillation;Cardiac Complexes, Premature;Computer Simulation;Databases, Factual;Heart;Heart;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Neurological;Quality Control;Reference Values;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","226","","24","IEEE","20 Mar 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Peer-to-peer content distribution is attractive in this setting because the bandwidth available to serve content scales with demand. A key challenge, however, is making content distribution robust to peer transience. Our approach to providing robustness is to introduce redundance; both in network paths and in data. We use multiple, diverse distribution trees to provide redundancy in network paths and multiple description coding (MDC) to provide redundancy in data. We present a simple tree management algorithm that provides the necessary path diversity and describe an adaptation framework for MDC based on scalable receiver feedback. We evaluate these using MDC applied to real video data coupled with real usage traces from a major news site that experienced a large flash crowd for live streaming content. Our results show very significant benefits in using multiple distribution trees and MDC, with a 22 dB improvement in PSNR in some cases.","1092-1648","0-7695-2024-3","10.1109/ICNP.2003.1249753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249753","","Peer to peer computing;Bandwidth;Network servers;Streaming media;Robustness;Costs;Web server;Feedback;PSNR;Surges","","225","9","38","IEEE","3 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Giotto specifies time-triggered sensor readings, task invocations, actuator updates, and mode switches independent of any implementation platform. Giotto can be annotated with platform constraints such as task-to-host mappings, and task and communication schedules. The annotations are directives for the Giotto compiler, but they do not alter the functionality and timing of a Giotto program. By separating the platform-independent from the platform-dependent concerns, Giotto enables a great deal of flexibility in choosing control platforms as well as a great deal of automation in the validation and synthesis of control software. The time-triggered nature of Giotto achieves timing predictability, which makes Giotto particularly suitable for safety-critical applications.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2002.805825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173196","","Communication system control;Application software;Timing;Automatic control;Control system synthesis;Real time systems;Logic programming;Actuators;Switches;Communication switching","","224","8","26","IEEE","29 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Standard orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, using a guard-time interval or cyclic prefix, combat intersymbol interference (ISI), but provide no protection against interchannel interference (ICI). This drawback has led to the introduction of pulse-shaping OFDM systems. We first present a general framework for pulse shape design. Our analysis shows that certain pulse shapes proposed in the literature are, in fact, optimal in a well-defined sense. Furthermore, our approach provides a simple way to adapt the pulse shape to varying channel conditions. We then show that (pulse-shaping) OFDM systems based on rectangular time-frequency lattices are not optimal for time- and frequency-dispersive wireless channels. This motivates the introduction of lattice-OFDM (LOFDM) systems which are based on general time-frequency lattices. Using results from sphere packing theory, we show how to design LOFDM systems (lattice and pulse shape) optimally for timeand frequency-dispersive channels in order to minimize the joint ISI/ICI. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulations, showing that LOFDM systems outperform traditional pulse-shaping OFDM systems with respect to robustness against ISI/ICI.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.814200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214833","","OFDM;Time frequency analysis;Dispersion;Intersymbol interference;Pulse shaping methods;Shape;Lattices;Doppler effect;Frequency division multiplexing;Protection","","223","2","36","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such SIW structures can largely preserve the advantages of conventional rectangular waveguides such as high-Q factor and high power capacity. However, they are subject to leakage due to periodic gaps, which potentially results in wave attenuation. Therefore, such a guided-wave modeling problem becomes a very complicated complex eigenvalue problem. Since the SIW are bilaterally unbounded, absorbing boundary conditions should be deployed in numerical algorithms. This often leads to a difficult complex root-extracting problem of a transcend equation. In this paper, we present a novel finite-difference frequency-domain algorithm with a perfectly matched layer and Floquet's theorem for the analysis of SIW guided-wave problems. In this scheme, the problem is converted into a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem and finally transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem that can be solved with efficient subroutines available.

First, we use an exact local expansion of the entropy function to prove almost sure consistency and central limit theorems for three of the most commonly used discretized information estimators. The setup is related to Grenander's method of sieves and places no assumptions on the underlying probability measure generating the data. Second, we prove a converse to these consistency theorems, demonstrating that a misapplication of the most common estimation techniques leads to an arbitrarily poor estimate of the true information, even given unlimited data. This “inconsistency” theorem leads to an analytical approximation of the bias, valid in surprisingly small sample regimes and more accurate than the usual  formula of Miller and Madow over a large region of parameter space. The two most practical implications of these results are negative: (1) information estimates in a certain data regime are likely contaminated by bias, even if “bias-corrected” estimators are used, and (2) confidence intervals calculated by standard techniques drastically underestimate the error of the most common estimation methods. Finally, we note a very useful connection between the bias of entropy estimators and a certain polynomial approximation problem. By casting bias calculation problems in this approximation theory framework, we obtain the best possible generalization of known asymptotic bias results. More interesting, this framework leads to an estimator with some nice properties: the estimator comes equipped with rigorous bounds on the maximum error over all possible underlying probability distributions, and this maximum error turns out to be surprisingly small. We demonstrate the application of this new estimator on both real and simulated data.","0899-7667","","10.1162/089976603321780272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790247","","","","222","3","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Perfect channel state information is assumed to be known to both transmitters and receivers. Asymptotic performance analysis shows that the system mutual information changes behavior as the interference becomes sufficiently strong. In particular, beamforming is the optimum signaling for all users when the interference is large. We propose several numerical approaches to decide the covariance matrices of the transmitted signals and compare their performance in terms of the system mutual information. We model the system as a noncooperative game and perform iterative water-filling to find the Nash equilibrium distributively. A centralized global approach and a distributed iterative approach based on the gradient projection method are also proposed. Numerical results show that all proposed approaches give better performance than the standard signaling, which is optimum for the case without interference.

Both cell and artificial planar bilayer membranes exhibit dramatic changes if the transmembrane voltage is raised to /spl sim/0.2 to 1 V by various electric field pulses. Ionic and molecular transport increases by orders of magnitude, with both reversible and irreversible outcomes. Initially the term breakdown was used, but ion pair generation of classic dielectric breakdown was ruled out. Instead, a stochastic pore hypothesis is consistent with features of electroporation in planar lipid membranes. There is a rapid, nonlinear conduction increase through a rapidly evolving pore population, and this causes the fast membrane discharge previously termed ""breakdown"". Phenomena due to primary aqueous pores and secondary processes such as heating and chemical exchange have been observed in planar bilayers, cell single systems encountered mainly in vitro, multicellular systems relevant to in vivo applications, and possibly subcellular structures such as mitochondria. For membrane systems that approach nanoscales, modified behavior should occur because of conformational constraints, and deterministic processes may become more important. Understanding electroporation is a subset of a general problem: obtaining a quantitative description of how electromagnetic field-altered changes in chemical species within a biological system govern observed effects.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2003.1237325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237325","","Biomembranes;Dielectric breakdown;Voltage;Stochastic processes;Lipidomics;Electric breakdown;Heating;Chemical processes;In vitro;In vivo","","219","29","187","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The deviation accumulation and transformation are quantitatively described by the state transition in the state space model. A systematic procedure that builds the model is presented and an experimental validation is also conducted. The validation result is satisfactory.

This new method does not utilize the customary explicit leapfrog time scheme of the conventional FDTD method. Instead we solve the time-domain Maxwell's equations by expressing the transient behaviors in terms of weighted Laguerre polynomials. By using these orthonormal basis functions for the temporal variation, the time derivatives can be handled analytically, which results in an implicit relation. In this way, the time variable is eliminated from the computations. By introducing the Galerkin temporal testing procedure, the marching-on in time method is replaced by a recursive relation between the different orders of the weighted Laguerre polynomials if the input waveform is of arbitrary shape. Since the weighted Laguerre polynomials converge to zero as time progresses, the electric and magnetic fields when expanded in a series of weighted Laguerre polynomials also converge to zero. The other novelty of this approach is that, through the use of the entire domain-weighted Laguerre polynomials for the expansion of the temporal variation of the fields, the spatial and the temporal variables can be separated.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2003.808732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191720","","Finite difference methods;Time domain analysis;Polynomials;Testing;Moment methods;Stability;Maxwell equations;Shape;Magnetic fields","","219","","10","IEEE","2 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among these properties this paper focuses on the estimation of apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap distribution, based on the results of space charge measurements. The depolarization characteristic obtained recording space charge magnitude when, after poling, electric field is removed and electrodes are short-circuited and grounded, is the experimental reference for the application of the expressions for apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap depth calculation derived in this paper. A simple relationship is proposed for apparent mobility, which is affected by significant approximations, but can be applied successfully for material characterization and aging investigation. It is applied to experimental results coming from space charge measurements carried out by the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique on cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) specimens, unaged and aged, cut from high-voltage cables. The trap depth distribution is calculated for the same material, and the results are cross-correlated with mobility estimates, revealing good agreement. Both apparent trap-controlled mobility and trap depth distribution reveal noticeable modifications with aging. The proposed methodology permits finding information on charge trapping/detrapping processes in polymeric materials, using a simple experimental procedure, as well as to extract quantities that seem very attractive as aging markers.","1558-4135","","10.1109/TDEI.2003.1194099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194099","","Degradation;Aging;Space charge;Polymers;Current measurement;Charge measurement;Pulse measurements;Plastic insulation;Chemicals;Microstructure","","219","","33","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To exploit the wavelet interscale dependencies we multiply the adjacent wavelet subbands to enhance edge structures while weakening noise. In the multiscale products, edges can be effectively distinguished from noise. Thereafter, an adaptive threshold is calculated and imposed on the products, instead of on the wavelet coefficients, to identify important features.

This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated.

A bandstop filter is introduced that uses a ring resonator with direct-connected orthogonal feed lines. A new bandpass filter based on the bandstop filter uses two tuning stubs to construct a wide-band passband with two sharp stopbands. Without coupling gaps between feed lines and rings, there are no mismatch and radiation losses between them and, therefore, the new filters show low insertion loss. In addition, a dual-mode characteristic is used to increase the stopband bandwidth of the new filters. A simple transmission-line model used to calculate the frequency responses of the filters shows good agreement with measurements. The filter using three cascaded rings has 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 49.3%, an insertion loss of better than 1.6 dB in the passband, a return loss of larger than 13 dB from 4.58 to 7.3 GHz, and two rejections of greater than 40 dB within 2.75-4.02 and 7.73-9.08 GHz.

Spatial MIMO channel capacity statistics are found to be well represented by the separate transmitter and receiver correlation matrices, with a median relative error in capacity of 3%, in contrast with the 18% median relative error observed by assuming the antennas to be uncorrelated. A reduced parameter model, consisting of 4 parameters, has been developed to statistically represent the channel correlation matrices. These correlation matrices are, in turn, used to generate H matrices with capacities that are consistent within a few percent of those measured in New York. The spatial channel model reported allows simulations of H matrices for arbitrary antenna configurations. These channel matrices may be used to test receiver algorithms in system performance studies. These results may also be used for antenna array design, as the decay of mobile antenna correlation with antenna separation has been reported here. An important finding for the base transmitter array was that the antennas were largely uncorrelated even at antenna separations as small as two wavelengths.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.809457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192170","","MIMO;Transmitters;Transmitting antennas;Mobile antennas;Channel capacity;Antenna arrays;Narrowband;Scattering;Error analysis;Receiving antennas","","219","2","19","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While many techniques have been proposed to reduce power consumption for uniprocessor systems, there has been considerably less work on multiprocessor systems. In this paper, based on the concept of slack sharing among processors, we propose two novel power-aware scheduling algorithms for task sets with and without precedence constraints executing on multiprocessor systems. These scheduling techniques reclaim the time unused by a task to reduce the execution speed of future tasks and, thus, reduce the total energy consumption of the system. We also study the effect of discrete voltage/speed levels on the energy savings for multiprocessor systems and propose a new scheme of slack reservation to incorporate voltage/speed adjustment overhead in the scheduling algorithms. Simulation and trace-based results indicate that our algorithms achieve substantial energy savings on systems with variable voltage processors. Moreover, processors with a few discrete voltage/speed levels obtain nearly the same energy savings as processors with continuous voltage/speed, and the effect of voltage/speed adjustment overhead on the energy savings is relatively small.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2003.1214320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214320","","Dynamic scheduling;Voltage;Real time systems;Energy consumption;Scheduling algorithm;Energy management;Power system management;Processor scheduling;Power system reliability;Multiprocessing systems","","219","4","26","IEEE","22 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is the highest gain reported for a two-stage design in CMOS at the 0.8-2.4-GHz frequency range.

Such devices are said to be inept in a precise technical sense that can be easily tested from an explicit mathematical criteria to be presented in this two-part tutorial review. Often an inept device can be redesigned into a smart device capable of computing and artificial intelligence by massaging the device's parameters, such as doping, concentration, geometrical profile, chemical moiety, etc., in accordance with the principle of local activity to be articulated in Part II. In particular, designing a smart nanodevice amounts to fine tuning the device parameters into a much smaller niche within the device's locally active parameter region called the edge of chaos where complexity abounds. Molecular and nanodevices will remain novelty toys for nanodevice specialists unless they possess realistic nonlinear circuit models so that future nano circuit designers can simulate their exotic designs as easily and accurately as current CMOS circuit designers. A mathematically consistent theory for modeling nonlinear, high-frequency nanodevices, specially those which exploited exotic tunneling and entanglement quantum mechanical effects, such as Coulomb blockade, quasi-particle dynamics, Kondo resonance, Aharonov-Bohm nonlocal interactions, etc., will require the introduction of a complete family of fundamental circuit elements as model building blocks. They are presented via a doubly periodic table of circuit elements somewhat reminiscent of Mendeleev's periodic table of chemical elements. These fundamental circuit elements can be compactly represented by a loop of four generic species of circuit elements wrapped around the surface of a torus where any higher order element having an arbitrarily high order of frequency dependence can be generated from one of them, modulo the integer 4, ad infinitum.

"Combining low-, high-level and empirical domain knowledge for automated segmentation of ultrasonic breast lesions","A. Madabhushi; D. N. Metaxas","Department of Bioengineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science, Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, USA",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,"22 Apr 2003","2003","22","2","155","169","Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of mortality in women . In the last decade, ultrasound along with digital mammography has come to be regarded as the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. Automatically detecting tumors and extracting lesion boundaries in ultrasound images is difficult due to their specular nature and the variance in shape and appearance of sonographic lesions. Past work on automated ultrasonic breast lesion segmentation has not addressed important issues such as shadowing artifacts or dealing with similar tumor like structures in the sonogram. Algorithms that claim to automatically classify ultrasonic breast lesions, rely on manual delineation of the tumor boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel technique to automatically find lesion margins in ultrasound images, by combining intensity and texture with empirical domain specific knowledge along with directional gradient and a deformable shape-based model. The images are first filtered to remove speckle noise and then contrast enhanced to emphasize the tumor regions. For the first time, a mathematical formulation of the empirical rules used by radiologists in detecting ultrasonic breast lesions, popularly known as the ""Stavros Criteria"" is presented in this paper. We have applied this formulation to automatically determine a seed point within the image. Probabilistic classification of image pixels based on intensity and texture is followed by region growing using the automatically determined seed point to obtain an initial segmentation of the lesion. Boundary points are found on the directional gradient of the image. Outliers are removed by a process of recursive refinement. These boundary points are then supplied as an initial estimate to a deformable model. Incorporating empirical domain specific knowledge along with low and high-level knowledge makes it possible to avoid shadowing artifacts and lowers the chance of confusing similar tumor like structures for the lesion. The system was validated on a database of breast sonograms for 42 patients. The average mean boundary error between manual and automated segmentation was 6.6 pixels and the normalized true positive area overlap was 75.1%. The algorithm was found to be robust to 1) variations in system parameters, 2) number of training samples used, and 3) the position of the seed point within the tumor. Running time for segmenting a single sonogram was 18 s on a 1.8-GHz Pentium machine.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194626","","Lesions;Breast neoplasms;Ultrasonic imaging;Sonogram;Breast cancer;Image segmentation;Shadow mapping;Deformable models;Mammography;Gold","Algorithms;Anatomy, Cross-Sectional;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Predictive Value of Tests;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ultrasonography, Mammary","217","6","54","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Depending on the situation, a peer may need to consider its trust in a specific aspect of another peer's capability or in multiple aspects. Bayesian networks provide a flexible method to present differentiated trust and combine different aspects of trust. The evaluation of the model using a simulation shows that the system where peers communicate their experiences (recommendations) outperforms the system where peers do not share recommendations with each other and that a differentiated trust adds to the performance in terms of percentage of successful interactions.","","0-7695-2023-5","10.1109/PTP.2003.1231515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231515","","Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Aggregates;IP networks;Ad hoc networks;Costs;Monitoring;Authorization","","217","1","19","IEEE","15 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using policies allows the security functionality to be modified without changing the implementation of the entities involved. However, along with being extremely dynamic, these environments also tend to span several domains and be made up of entities of varied capabilities.

By aligning SRRs with the slots, a high inductive coupling between line and rings is achieved, with the result of a sharp and narrow rejection band in the vicinity of the resonant frequency of the rings. In order to widen the stop band of the filter, several ring pairs tuned at equally spaced frequencies within the desired gap are cascaded. The frequency response measured in the fabricated prototype device exhibits pronounced slopes at either side of the stop band and near 0 dBs insertion loss outside that band. Since SRR dimensions are much smaller than signal wavelength, the proposed filters are extremely compact and can be used to reject frequency parasitics in CPW structures by simply patterning properly tuned SRRs in the back side metal.

Position control at low and zero speed is only possible using anisotropic effects considered in high-frequency models. The usually open loop carrier signal injection is impacted by nonlinear inverter properties like the dead-time effect. This paper discusses the influence of the dead time effect on the carrier signal excitation comparing alternating and revolving injection principles. To overcome disturbing effects an alternating injection procedure is proposed using a predefined injection angle. The approach reduces the effects of the inverter distortion voltages. As a result it is possible to track even small saliencies typical for surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines. For processing the high frequency current for position estimation, there is no additional hardware necessary within a standard drives with field oriented control.

We describe the details of our approach and show applications in the proximal femur, the knee, and the skull. The accuracy of the determination of geometrical parameters was analyzed using CT scans of the semi-anthropomorphic European spine phantom. Depending on the settings of the segmentation parameters cortical thickness could be determined with an accuracy corresponding to the side length of 1 to 2.5 voxels. The impact of noise on the segmentation was investigated by artificially adding noise to the CT data. An increase in noise by factors of two and five changed cortical thickness corresponding to the side length of one voxel. Intraoperator and interoperator precision was analyzed by repeated analysis of nine pelvic CT scans. Precision errors were smaller than 1% for trabecular and total volumes and smaller than 2% for cortical thickness. Intraoperator and interoperator precision errors were not significantly different.

The analysis and optimization of the LDPC component codes for the MLC and BICM schemes are complicated because, in general, the equivalent binary-input component channels are not necessarily symmetric. To overcome this obstacle, we deploy two different approaches: one based on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel adapters and the other based on coset codes. By incorporating i.i.d. channel adapters, we can force the symmetry of each binary-input component channel. By considering coset codes, we extend the concentration theorem based on previous work by Richardson et al. ( see ibid., vol.47, p.599-618, Feb. 2001) and Kavc/spl caron/ic/spl acute/ et al.(see ibid., vol.49, p.1636-52, July 2003) We also discuss the relation between the systems based on the two approaches and show that they indeed have the same expected decoder behavior. Next, we jointly optimize the code rates and degree distribution pairs of the LDPC component codes for the MLC scheme. The optimized irregular LDPC codes at each level of MLC with multistage decoding (MSD) are able to perform well at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) very close to the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We also show that the optimized BICM scheme can approach the parallel independent decoding (PID) capacity as closely as does the MLC/PID scheme. Simulations with very large codeword length verify the accuracy of the analytical results. Finally, we compare the simulated performance of these coded modulation schemes at finite codeword lengths, and consider the results from the perspective of a random coding exponent analysis.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.815777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226601","","Modulation coding;Parity check codes;Decoding;AWGN;Signal to noise ratio;Analytical models;Interleaved codes;Independent component analysis;Additive white noise;Performance analysis","","215","16","22","IEEE","4 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, no physical parameters can be derived exactly. In addition, when the robot picks up objects of uncertain lengths, orientations, or gripping points, the overall kinematics from the robot's base to the tip of the object becomes uncertain and changes according to different tasks. Consequently, it is unknown whether stability of the robot could be guaranteed in the presence of uncertain kinematics. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose simple feedback control laws for setpoint control without exact knowledge of kinematics, Jacobian matrix, and dynamics. Lyapunov functions are presented for stability analysis of feedback control problem with uncertain kinematics. We shall show that the end-effector's position converges to a desired position in a finite task space even when the kinematics and Jacobian matrix are uncertain.

However, the positioning systems based on GPS alone face great problems in the so-called urban canyon environments, where the GPS signals are often blocked by high-rise buildings and there are not enough available satellite signals to estimate the positioning information of a fix. To solve the problem, a constrained method is presented by approximately modeling the path of the vehicle in the urban canyon environments as pieces of lines. By adding this constraint, the minimum number of available satellites reduces to two, which is satisfied in many urban canyon environments. Then, different approaches using the constrained method are systematically developed. In addition, a state-augmentation method is proposed to simultaneously estimate the positions of the GPS receiver and the parameters of the line. Furthermore, the interacting multiple model method is used to determine the correct path which the vehicle follows after passing an intersection of roads. Simulation results show that this approach can solve the urban canyon problems successfully.","2374-958X","","10.1109/TRA.2002.807557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1177161","","Remotely operated vehicles;Mobile robots;Global Positioning System;Land vehicles;Road vehicles;Satellite navigation systems;State estimation;Kalman filters;Filtering;Urban areas","","213","","27","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The vector control with a synchronous reference frame current regulator was implemented with challenging requirements such as an extremely low stator inductance (28 /spl mu/H), a high DC-link voltage (600 V), and a high excitation frequency (1.2 kHz). Because the conventional position sensor is not reliable at super-high speed, two different schemes were proposed to measure the position of the rotor. As a first step, a vector control with three discrete Hall sensors was proposed. Because the discrete Hall sensors provide rough position information with a resolution of /spl plusmn/30/spl deg/, a position estimation algorithm was proposed to derive the precise position. Subsequently, a vector control scheme without any position sensor was proposed. The proposed sensorless algorithm was implemented by processing the output voltage of the proportional plus integral current regulator. Therefore, the structure is simple and the estimated speed is robust to the measurement noise. An experimental system was built and the proposed control was implemented and evaluated with and without the discrete Hall sensors. The test results, up to a speed of 65000 r/min, confirmed the validity of the proposed control.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2003.810658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201550","","Machine vector control;Regulators;Velocity measurement;Synchronous motors;Stators;Inductance;Frequency;Position measurement;Voltage;Noise robustness","","213","","11","IEEE","28 May 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide an analytic approach for the systematic development of controllers that will cause an autonomous vehicle to accomplish a smooth lane change suitable for use in an Automated Highway System. The design is motivated by the discontinuous availability of valid preview data from the sensing systems during lane-to-lane transitions. The task is accomplished by the generation of a virtual yaw reference and the utilization of a robust switching controller to generate steering commands that cause the vehicle to track that reference. In this way, the open loop lane change problem is converted into an equivalent virtual reference trajectory tracking problem. The approach considers optimality in elapsed time at an operating longitudinal velocity. Although the analysis is performed assuming that the road is straight, the generalization of the proposed algorithm to arbitrary road segments is rather straightforward. The outlined lane change algorithm has been implemented and tested on The Ohio State University test vehicles.

HPCA-9 2003. Proceedings.","28 Feb 2003","2003","","","129","140","Today's high performance processors tolerate long latency operations by means of out-of-order execution. However, as latencies increase, the size of the instruction window must increase even faster if we are to continue to tolerate these latencies. We have already reached the point where the size of an instruction window that can handle these latencies is prohibitively large in terms of both design complexity and power consumption. And, the problem is getting worse. This paper proposes runahead execution as an effective way to increase memory latency tolerance in an out-of-order processor without requiring an unreasonably large instruction window. Runahead execution unblocks the instruction window blocked by long latency operations allowing the processor to execute far ahead in the program path.

Super-peer networks strike a balance between the efficiency of centralized search, and the autonomy, load balancing and robustness to attacks provided by distributed search. Furthermore, they take advantage of the heterogeneity of capabilities (e.g., bandwidth, processing power) across peers, which recent studies have shown to be enormous. Hence, new and old P2P systems like KaZaA and Gnutella are adopting super-peers in their design. Despite their growing popularity, the behavior of super-peer networks is not well understood. For example, what are the potential drawbacks of super-peer networks? How can super-peers be made more reliable? How many clients should a super-peer take on to maximize efficiency? we examine super-peer networks in detail, gaming an understanding of their fundamental characteristics and performance tradeoffs. We also present practical guidelines and a general procedure for the design of an efficient super-peer network.","","0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260781","","Peer to peer computing;Network servers;Bandwidth;Costs;Computer science;Load management;Robustness;Guidelines;File servers;Fault tolerant systems","","211","35","25","IEEE","21 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a decentralized scheme that organizes the MSNs into an appropriate overlay structure that is particularly beneficial for real-time applications. We formulate our optimization criterion as a ""degree-constrained minimum average-latency problem"" which is known to be NP-hard. A key feature of this formulation is that it gives a dynamic priority to different MSNs based on the size of its service set. Our proposed approach iteratively modifies the overlay tree using localized transformations to adapt with changing distribution of MSNs, clients, as well as network conditions. We show that a centralized greedy approach to this problem does not perform quite as well, while our distributed iterative scheme efficiently converges to near-optimal solutions.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208987","","Application software;Spine;Streaming media;Large-scale systems;Internet;Multicast protocols;Jitter;Delay;Real time systems;Computer science","","211","14","15","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method is based on an iterative approach, where the fundamental frequency of the most prominent sound is estimated, the sound is subtracted from the mixture, and the process is repeated for the residual signal. For the estimation stage, an algorithm is proposed which utilizes the frequency relationships of simultaneous spectral components, without assuming ideal harmonicity. For the subtraction stage, the spectral smoothness principle is proposed as an efficient new mechanism in estimating the spectral envelopes of detected sounds. With these techniques, multiple fundamental frequency estimation can be performed quite accurately in a single time frame, without the use of long-term temporal features. The experimental data comprised recorded samples of 30 musical instruments from four different sources. Multiple fundamental frequency estimation was performed for random sound source and pitch combinations. Error rates for mixtures ranging from one to six simultaneous sounds were 1.8%, 3.9%, 6.3%, 9.9%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. In musical interval and chord identification tasks, the algorithm outperformed the average of ten trained musicians. The method works robustly in noise, and is able to handle sounds that exhibit inharmonicities. The inharmonicity factor and spectral envelope of each sound is estimated along with the fundamental frequency.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.815516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255467","","Frequency estimation;Signal processing;Music;Signal processing algorithms;Instruments;Signal analysis;Multiple signal classification;Humans;Speech;Iterative methods","","211","36","50","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These algorithms successfully solve the local inpainting problem but they must, by definition, give the same completion to any two holes that have the same boundary, even when the rest of the image is vastly different. We address a different, more global inpainting problem. How can we use the rest of the image in order to learn how to inpaint? We approach this problem from the context of statistical learning. Given a training image we build an exponential family distribution over images that is based on the histograms of local features. We then use this image specific distribution to inpaint the hole by finding the most probable image given the boundary and the distribution. The optimization is done using loopy belief propagation. We show that our method can successfully complete holes while taking into account the specific image statistics.

We start from a commonly used parametric statistical image model in which each voxel belongs to one single tissue type, and introduce an additional downsampling step that causes partial voluming along the borders between tissues. An expectation-maximization approach is used to simultaneously estimate the parameters of the resulting model and perform a PV classification. We present results on well-chosen simulated images and on real MR images of the brain, and demonstrate that the use of appropriate spatial prior knowledge not only improves the classifications, but is often indispensable for robust parameter estimation as well.

The technique enjoys numerous applications in biomedical signal analysis in the literature, especially in the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) brain signals. Standard implementations of ICA are restrictive mainly due to the square mixing assumption-for signal recordings which have large numbers of channels, the large number of resulting extracted sources makes the subsequent analysis laborious and highly subjective. There are many instances in neurophysiological analysis where there is strong a priori information about the signals being sought; temporally constrained ICA (cICA) can extract signals that are statistically independent, yet which are constrained to be similar to some reference signal which can incorporate such a priori information. We demonstrate this method on a synthetic dataset and on a number of artifactual waveforms identified in multichannel recordings of EEG and MEG. cICA repeatedly converges to the desired component within a few iterations and subjective analysis shows the waveforms to be of the expected morphologies and with realistic spatial distributions. This paper shows that cICA can be applied with great success to EM brain signal analysis, with an initial application in automating artifact extraction in EEG and MEG.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2003.816076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220217","","Independent component analysis;Signal analysis;Electroencephalography;Biomedical measurements;Data mining;Biomedical engineering;Digital recording;Principal component analysis;Electromagnetic measurements;Electromagnetic analysis","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Simulation;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Humans;Magnetoencephalography;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Principal Component Analysis;Quality Control","209","","26","IEEE","11 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Defense against these attacks is complicated by spoofed source IP addresses, which make it difficult to determine a packet's true origin. We propose Pi (short for path identifier), a new packet marking approach in which a path fingerprint is embedded in each packet, enabling a victim to identify packets traversing the same paths through the Internet on a per packet basis, regardless of source IP address spoofing. Pi features many unique properties. It is a per-packet deterministic mechanism: each packet traveling along the same path carries the same identifier This allows the victim to take a proactive role in defending against a DDoS attack by using the Pi mark to filter out packets matching the attackers' identifiers on a per packet basis.

"IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems","",,IEEE Std 1547-2003,"26 Aug 2003","2003","","","1","28","This standard is the first in the 1547 series of interconnection standards and is a benchmark milestone demonstrating the open consensus process for standards development. Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations.","","978-0-7381-3721-6","10.1109/IEEESTD.2003.94285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225051","certification codes commissioning;dc injection design;field;installation;production tests communications diesel generators distributed generation;power resources electric distribution systems dispersed generation;storage energy storage faults flicker fuel cells generators grid harmonics IEEE induction machines inverters interconnection requirements and specifications islanding microturbines monitoring and control paralleling power converters;networks;quality photovoltaic power systems point of common coupling public utility commissions reclosing coordination regulations rule making;federal;national;regional;state standards synchronous machines testing utilities wind energy systems","IEEE Standards;Power systems;Patents;Photovoltaic systems;Energy storage;Technical requirements","","208","44","20","","26 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

This controller does not need the knowledge of modal variables and spacecraft angular velocity. The absence of measurements of these variables is compensated by appropriate dynamics of the controller, which supplies their estimates. The Lyapunov technique is applied in the design of this dynamic controller. Possible source of instability of the controlled system in real cases are the influence of the flexibility on the rigid motion, the presence of disturbances acting on the structure, and parameter variations. In order to attenuate their effects and to damp out undesirable vibrations affecting the spacecraft attitude, distributed piezoelectric actuators are used. In fact, in presence of disturbances and/or parameter variation the proposed controller ensures an approximate solution of the control problem.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2003.1238733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238733","","Space vehicles;Control systems;Angular velocity;Piezoelectric actuators;Velocity measurement;Angular velocity control;Vibration measurement;Motion control;Costs;Motion measurement","","207","","23","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is based on the identification of single motor unit action potentials from the surface EMG signal with the use of the continuous wavelet transform. A manifestation variable is computed as the maximum of the outputs of a bank of matched filters at different scales. A threshold is applied to the manifestation variable to detect EMG activity. A model, based on the physical structure of the muscle, is used to test the proposed technique on synthetic signals with known features. The resultant bias of the onset estimate is lower than 40 ms and the standard deviation lower than 30 ms in case of additive colored Gaussian noise with signal-to-noise ratio as low as 2 dB. Comparison with previously developed methods was performed, and representative applications to experimental signals are presented.

All these new features allow high power density, efficient power conversion, and compact packaging. Complete descriptions of operating principle and design guidelines are provided in this paper. An extended state-space averaged model is developed to predict large- and small-signal characteristics of the converter in either direction of power flow.

Strong light injection can increase the semiconductor laser bandwidth to several times the free-running relaxation oscillation bandwidth. We focused on the fact that an injection-locked semiconductor laser can operate at an optical frequency different from its cavity resonance condition. Resonance is shifted from solitary resonance through the carrier-induced refractive-index change due to strong optical injection. We then framed a theory in which the enhanced resonance can be generated by transient interference between the injection-locked field and the field corresponding to the shifted cavity resonance. To examine the theory, we numerically investigated the rate equations and found that the numerical and theoretical results agree well over a wide range for strong injection. A stability analysis for the rate equations revealed that there is a mode transition from relaxation oscillation to interference-induced oscillation with increased injection, and the relaxation oscillation can become suppressed for higher injection levels. We believed that negligibly small fluctuations of the carrier suppressed the relaxation oscillation and examined it numerically. We also predict that, at strong injection levels, semiconductor lasers can be lower-dimensional systems because of the possibility of adiabatic elimination of the carrier. We further conclude that such low-dimensional systems can generate a high-frequency interference beat in the laser cavity and the resultant enhanced resonance.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2003.817583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233721","","Resonance;Bandwidth;Semiconductor lasers;Laser theory;Optical refraction;Equations;Frequency;Stability analysis;Interference suppression;Fluctuations","","207","2","20","IEEE","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Background on the basic operational characteristics of rolling element bearings is presented, and formulas given for the calculation of the characteristic fault frequencies. The shortcomings of conventional vibration spectral analysis for the detection of bearing faults is examined in the context of a synthetic vibration signal that students generate in MATLAB. This signal shares several key features of vibration signatures measured on bearing housings. Envelope analysis and the connection between bearing fault signatures and amplitude modulation/demodulation is explained. Finally, a graphically driven software utility (a set of MATLAB m-files) is introduced.

In the proposed scheme, the test vectors for the SOC are stored in compressed form in the tester memory and transferred to the chip where they are decompressed and applied to the cores. A small amount of on-chip circuitry is used to decompress the test vectors. Given the set of test vectors for a core, a modified Huffman code is carefully selected so that it satisfies certain properties. These properties guarantee that the codewords can be decoded by a simple pipelined decoder (placed at the serial input of the core's scan chain) that requires very small area.

As a step toward practical implementation of this technology in humans, we present an individualized method for selecting electroencephalogram (EEG) features and electrode locations for seizure prediction focused on precursors that occur within ten minutes of electrographic seizure onset. This method applies an intelligent genetic search process to EEG signals simultaneously collected from multiple intracranial electrode contacts and multiple quantitative features derived from these signals. The algorithm is trained on a series of baseline and preseizure records and then validated on other, previously unseen data using split sample validation techniques. The performance of this method is demonstrated on multiday recordings obtained from four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. An average probability of prediction (or block sensitivity) of 62.5% was achieved in this group, with an average block false positive (FP) rate of 0.2775 FP predictions/h, corresponding to 90.47% specificity. These findings are presented as an example of a method for training, testing and validating a seizure prediction system on data from individual patients.

The transducer membrane and cavity are defined on an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer and on a prime wafer, respectively. Then, using silicon direct bonding in a vacuum environment, the two wafers are bonded together to form a transducer. This new technique, capable of fabricating large CMUTs, offers advantages over the traditionally micromachined CMUTs. First, forming a vacuum-sealed cavity is relatively easy since the wafer bonding is performed in a vacuum chamber. Second, this process enables better control over the gap height, making it possible to fabricate very small gaps (less than 0.1 μm). Third, since the membrane is made of single crystal silicon, it is possible to predict and control the mechanical properties of the membrane to within 5%. Finally, the number of process steps involved in making a CMUT has been reduced from 22 to 15, shortening the device turn-around time. All of these advantages provide repeatable fabrication of CMUTs featuring predictable center frequency, bandwidth, and collapse voltage.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2003.809968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192707","","Ultrasonic transducers;Wafer bonding;Biomembranes;Silicon on insulator technology;Process control;Mechanical factors;Fabrication;Frequency;Bandwidth;Voltage","","206","19","28","IEEE","8 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We empirically evaluated two experimental systems based on the method using incremental naive Bayes and incremental tree inducer [ITI] as experts. For the sake of comparison, we also included Blum's implementation of weighted majority. On the STAGGER concepts and on the SEA concepts, results suggest that the ensemble method learns drifting concepts almost as well as the base algorithms learn each concept individually.

It is assumed that each node in the network senses an environment that can be described as a mixture of some elementary conditions. The measurements are thus statistically modeled with a mixture of Gaussians, where each Gaussian component corresponds to one of the elementary conditions. The paper presents a distributed expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the Gaussian components, which are common to the environment and sensor network as a whole, as well as the mixing probabilities that may vary from node to node. The algorithm produces an estimate (in terms of a Gaussian mixture approximation) of the density of the sensor data without requiring the data to be transmitted to and processed at a central location. Alternatively, the algorithm can be viewed as a distributed processing strategy for clustering the sensor data into components corresponding to predominant environmental features sensed by the network. The convergence of the distributed EM algorithm is investigated, and simulations demonstrate the potential of this approach to sensor network data analysis.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2003.814623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1212679","","Clustering algorithms;Gaussian processes;Gaussian distribution;Probability;Approximation algorithms;Gaussian approximation;Distributed processing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Convergence;Analytical models","","205","","17","IEEE","15 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By extending the time-bandwidth product (TBP) concept to fractional Fourier domains, a generalized time-bandwidth product (GTBP) is defined. For mono-component signals, it is shown that GTBP provides a rotation independent measure of compactness.

This broadcast strategy is an extension of the single-input single-output (SISO) broadcast approach. Perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed known at the receiver end only. This strategy facilitates to adapt the reliably decoded rate to the actual channel state without having any feedback link to the transmitter. Transmission of layered coded information is motivated by the theory of majorization. We derive the basic equations characterizing achievable rates of the strategy. Several ad hoc approximations to the achievable region are considered and their performance is compared with the SISO setting and the ergodic capacity. It has been demonstrated that a single-layer outage approach is reasonably efficient in the MIMO setting in terms of the average reliably decoded rate. A multiple-access channel (MAC) broadcast approach is also applied for the MIMO case, and demonstrated to be relatively efficient.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2003.817834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237140","","Broadcasting;Fading;MIMO;Decoding;Channel state information;Transmitters;Delay;Source coding;Image coding;Image quality","","205","4","39","IEEE","14 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Modularity refers to a new product development strategy in which interfaces shared among components in a given product architecture are specified and standardized to allow for greater substitutability of components across product families. It is argued that the degree of modularity inherent in product architectures depends on the constituent components and interfaces. This paper introduces a mathematical model, termed the modularization function, for analyzing the degree of modularity in a given product architecture. It takes into account the following variables: components; degree of coupling; and substitutability of new-to-the-firm components. The application of the modularization function is illustrated with two elevator systems from Schindler-traction and hydraulic. The comparative analysis of the elevators captures the sensitivity and dynamics of product architecture modularity created by three types of components (standard, neutral, and unique) and two types of interfaces (fundamental and optional).","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2003.810826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202983","","Product development;Elevators","","204","","55","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we evaluate extensively through analysis, simulation, and experimentation the interaction between the 802.11 MAC protocol and TCP. We identify four different regions of TCP unfairness that depend on the buffer availability at the base station, with some regions exhibiting significant unfairness of over 10 in terms of throughput ratio between upstream and downstream TCP flows.

Given a set of data records, each of which belongs to one of a number of predefined classes, the classification problem is concerned with the discovery of classification rules that can allow records with unknown class membership to be correctly classified. Many algorithms have been developed to mine large data sets for classification models and they have been shown to be very effective. However, when it comes to determining the likelihood of each classification made, many of them are not designed with such purpose in mind. For this, they are not readily applicable to such problems as churn prediction. For such an application, the goal is not only to predict whether or not a subscriber would switch from one carrier to another, it is also important that the likelihood of the subscriber's doing so be predicted. The reason for this is that a carrier can then choose to provide a special personalized offer and services to those subscribers who are predicted with higher likelihood to churn. Given its importance, we propose a new data mining algorithm, called data mining by evolutionary learning (DMEL), to handle classification problems of which the accuracy of each predictions made has to be estimated. In performing its tasks, DMEL searches through the possible rule space using an evolutionary approach that has the following characteristics: 1) the evolutionary process begins with the generation of an initial set of first-order rules (i.e., rules with one conjunct/condition) using a probabilistic induction technique and based on these rules, rules of higher order (two or more conjuncts) are obtained iteratively; 2) when identifying interesting rules, an objective interestingness measure is used; 3) the fitness of a chromosome is defined in terms of the probability that the attribute values of a record can be correctly determined using the rules it encodes; and 4) the likelihood of predictions (or classifications) made are estimated so that subscribers can be ranked according to their likelihood to churn. Experiments with different data sets showed that DMEL is able to effectively discover interesting classification rules. In particular, it is able to predict churn accurately under different churn rates when applied to real telecom subscriber data.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.819264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255389","","Data mining;Decision trees;Classification tree analysis;Gold;Switches;Accuracy;Performance evaluation;Induction generators;Character generation;Biological cells","","202","3","41","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper consists of a comprehensive treatise of this DNDP-based tracking control framework and extensive simulation studies for an Apache helicopter. A trim network is developed and seamlessly integrated into the neural dynamic programming (NDP) controller as part of a baseline structure for controlling complex nonlinear systems such as a helicopter. Design robustness is addressed by performing simulations under various disturbance conditions. All designs are tested using FLYRT, a sophisticated industrial scale nonlinear validated model of the Apache helicopter. This is probably the first time that an approximate dynamic programming methodology has been systematically applied to, and evaluated on, a complex, continuous state, multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear system with uncertainty. Though illustrated for helicopters, the DNDP control system framework should be applicable to general purpose tracking control.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2003.813839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215408","","Helicopters;Dynamic programming;Control systems;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear systems;Aerospace control;Robustness;Testing;Electrical equipment industry;MIMO","","202","","26","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For congestion control, we use the TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) algorithm. We extend TFRC to use an LDA when a connection uses at least one wireless link in the path between the sender and receiver. We then evaluate various LDAs under different wireless network topologies, competing traffic, and fairness scenarios to determine their effectiveness. In addition to evaluating LDAs derived from previous work, we also propose and evaluate a new LDA, ZigZag, and a hybrid LDA, ZBS, that selects among base LDAs depending upon observed network conditions. We evaluate these LDAs via simulation, and find that no single base algorithm performs well across all topologies and competition. However, the hybrid algorithm performs well across topologies and competition, and in some cases exceeds the performance of the best base LDA for a given scenario. All of the LDAs are reasonably fair when competing with TCP, and their fairness among flows using the same LDA depends on the network topology.

The lasers are found to operate bidirectionally up to twice the threshold, where unidirectional operation starts. Bidirectional operation reveals that just above threshold, the lasers operate in a regime where the two counterpropagating modes are continuous wave. As the injected current is increased, a new regime appears where the intensities of the two counterpropagating modes undergo alternate sinusoidal oscillations with frequency in the tens of megahertz range. The regime with alternate oscillations was previously observed in ring lasers of the gas and dye type, and it is here reported and investigated in semiconductor ring lasers. A theoretical model based on a mean field approach for the two counterpropagating modes is proposed to study the semiconductor ring laser dynamics. Numerical results are in agreement with the regime sequence experimentally observed when the injected current is increased (i.e., bidirectional continuous-wave, bidirectional with alternate oscillations, unidirectional). The boundaries of the different regimes are studied as a function of the relevant parameters, which turn out to be the pump current and the conservative and dissipative scattering coefficients, responsible for an explicit linear coupling between the two counterpropagating field modes. By a fitting procedure, we obtain good numerical agreement between experiment and theory, and also an estimation for the otherwise unknown scattering parameters.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2003.817585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233720","","Laser modes;Ring lasers;Semiconductor lasers;Laser theory;Waveguide lasers;Gas lasers;Scattering parameters;Semiconductor waveguides;Waveguide theory;Frequency","","199","","29","IEEE","29 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Misuse cases have many possible applications and interact with use cases in interesting and helpful ways. The paper discusses the elicitation of safety requirements from failure cases and considers the interplay of design, functional, and nonfunctional requirements.","1937-4194","","10.1109/MS.2003.1159030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159030","","Computer aided software engineering;Failure analysis;Security;Hazards;Costs;Protection;Engines;Safety;Cause effect analysis;System analysis and design","","199","","10","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This method is based on the simulation of physically plausible, biomechanical tissue deformations using finite-element methods. Applying a range of displacements to finite-element models of different patient anatomies generates model solutions which simulate gold standard deformations. From these solutions, deformed images are generated with a range of deformations typical of those likely to occur in vivo. The registration accuracy with respect to the finite-element simulations is quantified by co-registering the deformed images with the original images and comparing the recovered voxel displacements with the biomechanically simulated ones. The functionality of the validation method is demonstrated for a previously described nonrigid image registration technique based on free-form deformations using B-splines and normalized mutual information as a voxel similarity measure, with an application to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography image pairs. The exemplar nonrigid registration technique is shown to be of subvoxel accuracy on average for this particular application. The validation method presented here is an important step toward more generic simulations of biomechanically plausible tissue deformations and quantification of tissue motion recovery using nonrigid image registration. It will provide a basis for improving and comparing different nonrigid registration techniques for a diversity of medical applications, such as intrasubject tissue deformation or motion correction in the brain, liver or heart.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2002.808367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194634","","Image registration;Finite element methods;Breast;Deformable models;Medical simulation;Biomedical imaging;Anatomy;Gold;Image generation;In vivo","Artifacts;Breast;Breast Neoplasms;Breast Neoplasms;Echo-Planar Imaging;Echo-Planar Imaging;Female;Finite Element Analysis;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Motion;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","199","1","42","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining, respectively, 47% and 37% of the variance. The second method was a qualitative analysis of respondents' free-format comments.

Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes.

First, we show that it is not good to be constrained by the condition T>P, where T is the frame length of the DFT and P is the length of the room impulse responses. We show that there is an optimum frame size that is determined by the trade-off between maintaining the number of samples in each frequency bin to estimate statistics and covering the whole reverberation. We also clarify the reason for the poor performance of BSS in long reverberant environments, highlighting that the framework of BSS works as two sets of frequency-domain adaptive beamformers. Although BSS can reduce reverberant sounds to some extent like adaptive beamformers, they mainly remove the sounds from the jammer direction. This is the reason for the difficulty of BSS in reverberant environments.","1558-2353","","10.1109/TSA.2003.809193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193577","","Frequency domain analysis;Blind source separation;Speech;Source separation;Frequency estimation;Reverberation;Finite impulse response filter;Proposals;Statistics;Jamming","","196","1","18","IEEE","15 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The operators offer locality, heritability, and computational efficiency. Initialization and recombination depend on an underlying random spanning-tree algorithm. Three choices for this algorithm, based on the minimum spanning-tree algorithms of Prim and Kruskal and on random walks, respectively, are examined analytically and empirically. We demonstrate the usefulness of the edge-set encoding in an EA for the NP-hard degree-constrained minimum spanning-tree problem. The algorithm's operators are easily extended to generate only feasible spanning trees and to incorporate local, problem-specific heuristics.

We show that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense on m /spl ges/ 2 processors even when feasibility is guaranteed a priori. Then, we develop our framework where load balancing plays a major role in producing energy-efficient partitionings. We evaluate the feasibility and energy-efficiency performances of partitioning heuristics experimentally.","1530-2075","0-7695-1926-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213225","","Real time systems;Processor scheduling;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Computer science;Energy efficiency;Dynamic scheduling;Runtime;Load management;Performance evaluation","","196","1","21","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on incorporating ""generic"" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and ""prior"" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The ""posterior"" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a ""prior"" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238476","","Bayesian methods;Humans;Computer vision;Probability density function;Cats;Face detection;Airplanes;Motorcycles;Testing;Animals","","196","1","18","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most rule induction and decision tree algorithms perform a local, greedy search to generate classification rules that are often more complex than necessary. Evolutionary algorithms for pattern classification have recently received increased attention because they can perform global searches. In this paper, we propose a new approach for discovering classification rules by using gene expression programming (GEP), a new technique of genetic programming (GP) with linear representation. The antecedent of discovered rules may involve many different combinations of attributes. To guide the search process, we suggest a fitness function considering both the rule consistency gain and completeness. A multiclass classification problem is formulated as multiple two-class problems by using the one-against-all learning method. The covering strategy is applied to learn multiple rules if applicable for each class. Compact rule sets are subsequently evolved using a two-phase pruning method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and the integration theory. Our approach is also noise tolerant and able to deal with both numeric and nominal attributes. Experiments with several benchmark data sets have shown up to 20% improvement in validation accuracy, compared with C4.5 algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed GEP approach is more efficient and tends to generate shorter solutions compared with canonical tree-based GP classifiers.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2003.819261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255388","","Gene expression;Genetic programming;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Decision trees;Induction generators;Evolutionary computation;Pattern classification;Linear programming;Learning systems","","195","2","57","IEEE","7 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, each network layer (including physical layer, media access control (MAC), transport, and application layers) provides a separate solution to these challenges by providing its own optimized adaptation and protection mechanisms. However, this layered strategy does not always result in an optimal overall performance for the transmission of video. Moreover, certain protection strategies can be implemented simultaneously in several layers and, hence, the optimal choices from the application and complexity perspective need to be identified. In this paper, we evaluate different error control and adaptation mechanisms available in the different layers for robust transmission of video, namely MAC retransmission strategy, application-layer forward error correction, bandwidth-adaptive compression using scalable coding, and adaptive packetization strategies. Subsequently, we propose a novel adaptive cross-layer protection strategy for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of scalable video transmission by performing tradeoffs between throughput, reliability, and delay depending on the channel conditions and application requirements. The results obtained using the proposed adaptive cross-layer protection strategies show a significantly improved visual performance for the transmitted video over a variety of channel conditions.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.815231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254589","","Protection;Robustness;Video compression;Streaming media;Wireless LAN;Bandwidth;Physical layer;Media Access Protocol;Error correction;Robust control","","195","13","13","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The attenuated frequencies are each located apart from the bandpass frequencies and controlled by means of n transmission zeros introduced through original dual-behavior resonators (DBRs). These resonators are based on the association of different parallel open-ended stubs and allow the designer to independently control the in-band and out-of-band responses of the filter. A global synthesis approach is also discussed on a simplified architecture based on stepped impedance stubs, and the experimental results shown clearly validate the proposed concept.

This paper describes the implementation and experiences with a WAP-based telemedicine system for patient-monitoring that has been developed in our laboratory. It utilizes WAP devices as mobile access terminals for general inquiry and patient-monitoring services. Authorized users can browse the patients' general data, monitored blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG) on WAP devices in store-and-forward mode. The applications, written in wireless markup language (WML), WMLScript, and Perl, resided in a content server. A MySQL relational database system was set up to store the BP readings, ECG data, patient records, clinic and hospital information, and doctors' appointments with patients. A wireless ECG subsystem was built for recording ambulatory ECG in an indoor environment and for storing ECG data into the database. For testing, a WAP phone compliant with WAP 1.1 was used at GSM 1800 MHz by circuit-switched data (CSD) to connect to the content server through a WAP gateway, which was provided by a mobile phone service provider in Hong Kong. Data were successfully retrieved from the database and displayed on the WAP phone.

We present a framework for implementing dynamic analyses and optimizations. We provide an interface for building external modules, or clients, for the DynamoRIO dynamic code modification system. This interface abstracts away many low-level details of the DynamoRIO runtime system while exposing a simple and powerful, yet efficient and lightweight API. This is achieved by restricting optimization units to linear streams of code and using adaptive levels of detail for representing instructions. The interface is not restricted to optimization and can be used for instrumentation, profiling, dynamic translation, etc. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our framework, we implemented several optimizations. These improve the performance of some applications by as much as 40% relative to native execution.

"Image segmentation with ratio cut","S. Wang; J. M.

The cut ratio is defined as the ratio of the corresponding sums of two different weights of edges along the cut boundary and models the mean affinity between the segments separated by the boundary per unit boundary length. This new cost function allows the image perimeter to be segmented, guarantees that the segments produced by bipartitioning are connected, and does not introduce a size, shape, smoothness, or boundary-length bias. The latter allows it to produce segmentations where boundaries are aligned with image edges. Furthermore, the cut-ratio cost function allows efficient iterated region-based segmentation as well as pixel-based segmentation. These properties may be useful for some image-segmentation applications. While the problem of finding a minimum ratio cut in an arbitrary graph is NP-hard, one can find a minimum ratio cut in the connected planar graphs that arise during image segmentation in polynomial time. While the cut ratio, alone, is not sufficient as a baseline method for image segmentation, it forms a good basis for an extended method of image segmentation when combined with a small number of standard techniques. We present an implemented algorithm for finding a minimum ratio cut, prove its correctness, discuss its application to image segmentation, and present the results of segmenting a number of medical and natural images using our techniques.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2003.1201819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201819","","Image segmentation;Cost function;Polynomials;Partitioning algorithms;Image edge detection;Pixel;Shape;Biomedical imaging;Machine vision;Weight measurement","","194","1","23","IEEE","5 Jun 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, we give conditions under which an M-dimensional asynchronous mobile swarm with a fixed communication topology following an ""edge-leader"" can maintain cohesion during movements even in the presence of sensing delays and asynchronism. In addition, the swarm movement flexibility is analyzed. Such stability analysis is of fundamental importance if one wants to understand the coordination mechanisms for groups of autonomous vehicles or robots, where intermember communication channels are less than perfect and collisions must be avoided.","1558-2523","","10.1109/TAC.2002.806657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1166526","","Stability analysis;Topology;Mobile communication;Mobile robots;Remotely operated vehicles;Delay;Animals;Automotive engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Convergence","","194","","38","IEEE","22 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Simultaneous measurements of drain current and surface potential indicate that large change in surface potential after stress is responsible for the reduction in drain current in these devices. Measurements of surface potential profile from the gate edge toward the drain as a function of time indicate that surface potential changes occur mostly near the gate. It is proposed that the surface potential changes are caused by electrons which tunnel from the gate under high bias stress and get trapped at the surface states near the gate. Passivation of the surface with SiN/sub x/ reduces the transient magnitudes to a large extent. This correlates with a large improvement in microwave power performance in these devices after passivation.

Both stages are based on fuzzy rules which make use of membership functions. The filter can be applied iteratively to effectively reduce heavy noise. In particular, the shape of the membership functions is adapted according to the remaining noise level after each iteration, making use of the distribution of the homogeneity in the image. A statistical model for the noise distribution can be incorporated to relate the homogeneity to the adaptation scheme of the membership functions.

A key ingredient of the new strategy is the bridge test, which boosts the sampling density inside narrow passages. The bridge test relies on simple tests of local geometry and can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The strengths of the bridge test and uniform sampling complement each other naturally and are combined to generate the final hybrid sampling strategy. Our planner was tested on point robots and articulated robots in planar workspaces.

Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection may result. Feature ranking and selection, therefore, is an important issue in intrusion detection. We apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs and neural networks to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data. Important features for each of the 5 classes of intrusion patterns in the DARPA data are identified. It is shown that SVM-based and neural network based IDSs using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance. An IDS for class-specific detection based on five SVMs is proposed.","","0-7695-1872-9","10.1109/SAINT.2003.1183050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183050","","Computer vision;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Neural networks;Computer crime;TCPIP;Local area networks;Computer science;Information systems;Telecommunication traffic","","193","","18","IEEE","28 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To simplify the computations, we derive an approximate upper bound under the assumption of weak turbulence. The accuracy of this approximation under weak turbulence is verified by numerical simulation. Its invalidity when applied to strong turbulence is also shown. This simple approximate upper bound to the pairwise codeword-error probability is then applied to derive an upper bound to the bit-error probability for block codes, convolutional codes, and turbo codes for free-space optical communication through weak atmospheric turbulence channels.

Second-order intermodulation products generated by the input transconductor or due to self-mixing usually contribute to determine the IIP2 even though they can, at least in principle, be eliminated. The parasitic capacitance loading the switching-stage common source plays a key role in the intermodulation mechanisms. Moreover, the paper shows that, besides direct conversion and low intermediate frequency (IF), even superheterodyne receivers can suffer from second-order intermodulation if the IF is not carefully chosen.

The equivalent radices are extracted in the background by using a digital correlation method. The proposed calibration technique takes advantage of the digital redundancy architecture inherent to most pipelined ADCs. In the proposed method, the SNR is not degraded from the pseudorandom noise sequence injected into the system.

The performance of channel-aware scheduling algorithms has mostly been explored at the packet level for a static user population, often assuming infinite backlogs. In the present paper, we focus on the performance at the flow level in a dynamic setting with random finite-size service demands. We show that in certain cases the user-level performance may be evaluated by means of a multiclass Processor-Sharing model where the total service rate varies with the total number of users. The latter model provides explicit formulas for the distribution of the number of active users of the various classes, the mean response times, the blocking probabilities, and the mean throughput. In addition we show that, in the presence of channel variations, greedy, myopic strategies which maximize throughput in a static scenario, may result in sub-optimal throughput performance for a dynamic user configuration and cause potential instability effects.","0743-166X","0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208684","","Scheduling algorithm;Intelligent networks;Throughput;Delay;Processor scheduling;Multiaccess communication;Telecommunication traffic;Laboratories;Mathematics;Computer science","","191","6","20","IEEE","9 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel method for,selecting such a model is also presented. The degradation in steady-state performance is dealt with using a command input adjustment technique. When a fault is detected by the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) scheme, the reconfigurable controller is designed automatically using an eigenstructure assignment algorithm in an explicit model-following framework so that the dynamics of the closed-loop system follow that of the degraded reference model. In the mean time, the command input is also adjusted automatically to prevent the actuators from saturation. The proposed method has been evaluated using the lateral dynamics of an F-8 aircraft against actuator faults subject to constraints on the magnitude of actuator inputs.

For the communication, scalable and compositional interconnects, such as networks on chip (NoC) must be used. In this paper, we show that guaranteed services are essential in achieving this decoupling. Guarantees typically come at the cost of lower resource utilization. To avoid this, they must be used in combination with best-effort services. The key element of our NoC is a router consisting conceptually of two parts: the so-called guaranteed throughput (GT) and best-effort (BE) routers. We combine the GT and BE router architectures in an efficient implementation by sharing resources. We show the trade offs between hardware complexity and efficiency of the combined router, and the motivation of our choices. Our reasoning for the trade offs is validated with a prototype router implementation. We show a lay-out of an input-queued wormhole 5/spl times/5 router with an aggregate bandwidth of 80 Gbit/s. It occupies 0.26 mm/sup 2/ in CMOS12. This shows that our router provides high performance at reasonable cost, bringing NoCs one step closer.","1530-1591","0-7695-1870-2","10.1109/DATE.2003.1253633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253633","","Intelligent networks;Network-on-a-chip;Costs;Hardware;Prototypes;Aggregates;Bandwidth;Technology management;Wires;Laboratories","","191","6","16","IEEE","19 Dec 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The presented process does not require much wafer handling and only two photolithography steps are required. Using a 3×3 mm2 chip in a typical application, e.g., vaccine delivery, a 100 μl volume of aqueous fluid injected in 2 s would cause a pressure drop of less than 2 kPa.

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database.","","0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238478","","Labeling;Markov random fields;Application software;Image segmentation;Computer vision;Context modeling;Robots;Power generation;Training data;Image databases","","190","8","22","IEEE","3 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system consists of two modules: the feature extraction and the classification modules. The feature extraction module calculates the average gray level and 48 texture characteristics, which are derived from the spatial gray-level co-occurrence matrices, obtained from the ROIs. The classifier module consists of three sequentially placed feed-forward neural networks (NNs). The first NN classifies into normal or pathological liver regions. The pathological liver regions are characterized by the second NN as cyst or ""other disease"". The third NN classifies ""other disease"" into hemangioma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Three feature selection techniques have been applied to each individual NN: the sequential forward selection, the sequential floating forward selection, and a genetic algorithm for feature selection. The comparative study of the above dimensionality reduction methods shows that genetic algorithms result in lower dimension feature vectors and improved classification performance.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2003.813793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1229853","","Computer networks;Lesions;Design optimization;Neural networks;Computed tomography;Feature extraction;Pathology;Liver diseases;Genetic algorithms;Design automation","Algorithms;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular;Cysts;Cysts;Hemangioma;Hemangioma;Humans;Liver;Liver Neoplasms;Liver Neoplasms;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","190","21","28","IEEE","8 Sep 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the cellular events responsible for these responses may be anti-inflammatory in nature, we have tested the effectiveness of dexamethasone and cyclosporin A as potential drugs for developing intervention strategies following insertion of single-shank micromachined silicon devices. Peripheral injection of dexamethasone was effective in attenuating increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and astrocyte hyperplasia observed during both initial- and sustained-reactive responses observed at one and six weeks post insertion, respectively. Peripheral injection of cyclosporin A had no positive effect. If anything, application of this drug increased the early reactive response. Effectiveness of local release of dexamethasone in rat neocortex was tested by inserting ribbons of poly (ethyl-vinyl) acetate containing 35% (w/w) dexamethasone. Initial concentrations of dexamethasone were similar to those obtained by peripheral injection. Local drug release provided continued control of cellular reactive responses during the six-week study period. These results demonstrate that peripheral delivery of dexamethasone can be used to control reactive responses and that local drug delivery by slow-release from biocompatible polymers may be a more effective method of drug intervention. Incorporating these strategies on micromachined devices may provide an intervention strategy that will insure the chronic functioning of electrodes on intracortical neuroprosthetic devices.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2003.814800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214717","","Prosthetics;Electrodes;Testing;Drug delivery;Polymers;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical engineering;Chemical engineering;Silicon devices;Proteins","Animals;Coated Materials, Biocompatible;Cyclosporine;Delayed-Action Preparations;Dexamethasone;Electrodes;Injections, Subcutaneous;Male;Nervous System Diseases;Prostheses and Implants;Prosthesis-Related Infections;Prosthesis-Related Infections;Rats","190","2","17","IEEE","28 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The magnetohydrodynamic approach is applied. Of importance is the consideration of energy balance. Heat flux densities to the anode are predicted in the right order of magnitude and essential physical details of the high-current vacuum arc are disclosed. Only at low or no axial magnetic field superimposed externally and low-arc currents, the anode-directed flow of plasma of diffuse arcs reveals supersonic conditions. Otherwise, subsonic conditions exist. In supersonic diffuse arcs, the anode-directed plasma flow is decelerated and highest pressures appear in front of the anode. At subsonic conditions the highest pressure prevails in the cathode region and the pressure gradient drives the flow to the anode. The transition from diffuse to diffuse columnar arc seems to occur when the evaporation rate of metal vapor from the contact surfaces approaches the emission rate of plasma from the body of cathode spots. Diffuse columnar arcs have moderate pressure variations from cathode to anode. With rising plasma density, the energy loss from the emission of electromagnetic radiation increases and can no longer be neglected.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2003.818436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240032","","Numerical simulation;Vacuum arcs;Magnetic fields;Anodes;Plasma density;Cathodes;Interrupters;Magnetohydrodynamics;Energy loss;Electromagnetic radiation","","189","","30","IEEE","27 Oct 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
